In order to increase the number of colors employed in colorizing two-dimensional (2-D) barcodes, a number of parallel algorithms have been proposed, such as the multilevel graph partitioning and sparse matrix ordering @cite  .
 The parallel algorithms can be divided into two main categories: the sequential and the sequential methods .
 The sequential methods can be classified into two categories: sequential and sequential .
 In sequential methods, the sequential algorithms are classified into three categories: (1) sequential, (2) sequential and (3) sequential .
 For sequential algorithms, a sequential algorithm is proposed to reduce the computational cost of the sequential algorithm .
 In the sequential method, the parallel algorithms are divided into three groups: sequential, sequential, and sequential In @cite , a stochastic gradient method for optimizing the sum of a finite set of smooth functions was proposed .
 The method incorporates a memory of previous gradient values in order to achieve a linear convergence rate .
 In this method, the gradient values of the previous gradient value are stored in a memory and used to accelerate the training process .
 However, the memory is not used in this method .
 In addition, the method does not consider the parallel forward and backward substitutions, which are not considered in this paper .
 Moreover, the proposed method is not applicable in the parallel ICCG solver .
