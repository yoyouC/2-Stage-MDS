@cite proposed a new supervision signal called center loss .
 The center loss simultaneously learns a center for deep features of each class and penalizes the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers .
 The proposed method is trainable and easy to optimize in the CNNs .
 With the joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss, the proposed method can train a robust CNNs to obtain deep features with the two key learning objectives, inter-class dispension and intra-class compactness as much as possible, which are very essential to face recognition tasks .
 In this paper, we propose a new method called AM-Softmax, which is based on the SincNet .
