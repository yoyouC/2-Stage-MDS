Recently, end-to-end AES models have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, such as image classification @cite , semantic segmentation @math , and natural language processing @math  .
 The state-of-the-art AES models can be divided into two categories: feature-engineered models and end to-end models .
 Feature-based models are mainly used for image classification, semantic segmenting, and segmentation, e .
g .
 image captioning .
 The feature-engineering models are usually based on hand-crafted features, which are then used to extract features from the extracted features .
 For example, the CNNs are used for the segmentation task, and the CNN is used for segmentation .
 The CNNs
