Weakly-supervised action localization is a challenging computer vision problem with numerous real-world applications .
 Most existing methods are based on hand-crafted features .
 @cite proposed a framework to learn action features from video-level labels and then apply them to action localization in untrimmed long videos .
 In this work, we propose a novel formulation to learn discriminative action features with enhanced localization capabilities .
 In addition, we introduce a new formulation to enhance the discriminability of learned action features to improve the localization capabilities of action localization models .
 We also propose an adapted multi-label center loss term to ensure the separability and delineate adjacent action sequences, leading to improved localization capability .
