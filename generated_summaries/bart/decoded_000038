Semantic labels have been widely used in the computer vision community for image deblurring .
 @cite proposed a multi-stream architecture for image segmentation .
 They used a saliency model as additional information and imposed local structure losses to regularize the output of the network .
 They proposed a novel network architecture called the label refinement network that predicts segmentation labels in a coarse-to-fine fashion and learns to combine their outputs into the final deblurred result .
 The proposed UMSN architecture is similar to the one proposed in this paper .
 However, the UMSN is trained in a two-stream fashion .
 In the first stage, the segmentation label is obtained from image-level labels, while in the second stage, it is learned Recently, multi-stream architectures have been proposed for face segmentation .
 @cite proposed a multi-scale region-based Convolution Neural Network (CMS-RCNN) to jointly estimate the rain-streaks and rain-st streaks in a single image .
 The proposed method is based on a two-stream architecture, which consists of the region proposal component and the region-of-interest (RoI) detection component .
 In addition to the region proposals component, the RoI detection component is used to deal with tiny face regions .
 In contrast to the above methods, the proposed UMSN architecture is trained in an end-to-end fashion .
