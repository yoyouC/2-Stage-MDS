@cite proposed an end-to-end framework named Event Adversarial Neural Network (EANN), which can derive event-invariant features and thus benefit the detection of fake news on newly arrived events .
 It consists of three main components: the multi-modal feature extractor, the fake news detector, and the event discriminator .
 It cooperates with the event-specific features to learn the discriminable representation for detecting fake news .
 @cite presented a novel framework to extract the textual and visual features from fake news posts .
 The authors proposed an event adversarial neural network (ANN) to extract event features from the posts .
 Fake news detection has been extensively studied in the literature .
 @cite proposed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based method to detect fake samples generated by Twitter users using techniques including statistical analysis and comparison of raw pixel values and features extracted from them, and data mining techniques to identify fake samples obtained by the real data .
 In this paper, we propose a novel framework Multi-domain Visual Neural Network (MVNN) to fuse the visual information of frequency and pixel domains, and utilize a multi-branch CNN-RNN model to extract visual features from different semantic levels in the frequency domain .
 @cite proposed a multi-relationship embedding framework TriFN, which models publisher-news relations and user-news interactions simultaneously for fake news detection .
 @cite investigated the use of social media to detect fake news on microblogging platforms .
 They proposed a novel method of exploiting social context to detect false information on microblogs .
 They also proposed a tri-relationships embedding model to model user- news interactions simultaneously .
 They further proposed a TriFN framework to model publisher- news relations simultaneously for news verification .
 They conducted experiments on two real-world datasets collected from Sina Weibo .
 They demonstrated that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline methods .
