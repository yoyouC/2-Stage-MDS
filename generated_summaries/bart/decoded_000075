Point cloud reconstruction has been extensively studied in computer vision .
 Early works on point cloud reconstruction relied on hand-crafted features @cite @math , which were then used to reconstruct the entire point cloud .
 Recently, deep learning-based methods have been proposed to address this problem .
 For example, Li al proposed a 3D-LMNet, which learns a mapping from the 2D image to the corresponding learnt embedding, and then uses the learned embedding to generate a dense 3D reconstruction .
 In contrast, our method is based on a pyramidal network that predicts a point cloud of increasing resolution, while also providing a light-weight and scalable architecture .
 Point cloud reconstruction has been extensively studied in computer vision .
 @cite proposed a CNN-based architecture to reconstruct a point cloud from a 2D grid .
 The authors proposed EdgeConv, a generic architecture that incorporates local neighborhood information to reconstruct an arbitrary point cloud .
 The proposed architecture can be stacked or recurrently applied to learn global shape properties, and in multi-layer systems affinity in feature space captures semantic characteristics over potentially long distances in the original embedding .
 In addition, the authors proposed a novel folding-based decoder deforms a canonical 3D grid onto the underlying 3D object surface, achieving low reconstruction errors even for delicate structures .
 3D point clouds have been widely used in computer vision for object detection @cite , object pose estimation and 3D pose estimation .
 In recent years, deep learning based point cloud reconstruction has been successfully applied to a wide range of computer vision tasks, such as object detection, pose estimation, object segmentation, and pose estimation  .
 Most of these methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are trained on a large set of 2D images .
 In contrast to these methods, our method is based on a pyramidal network that predicts a point cloud of increasing resolution, while also providing a light-weight architecture for predicting high-resolution outputs .
