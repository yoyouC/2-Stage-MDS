Text clustering is a very useful task in many text processing applications like document summarization, question answering, etc .
 @cite proposed a clustering approach based on the word embeddings .
 The clustering process is performed by selecting a subset of words phrases from a document that can describe the meaning' of the document .
 In this work, we use a graph-based ranking algorithm to make use of both the local information in the specified document and the global information in neighbor documents .
 The results show that the proposed method can effectively structure an unordered text document into a large number of unordered sections .
