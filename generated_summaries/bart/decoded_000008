Recently, deep reinforcement learning has been applied to chatbot dialogue @cite  .
 In this work, we focus on building a dialogue management system that learns to collectively complete multiple subtasks, such as booking a flight and booking a hotel check-in .
 In this paper, we build a dialogue manager that operates at different temporal scales, and a global state tracker that helps ensure all cross-subtask constraints be satisfied .
 In the past few years, there has been a surge of interest in using deep RL to learn dialogue management systems .
 In particular, deep RL has been used to learn a dialogue agent that can solve complex tasks such as travel planning and information retrieval .
 In @cite , the authors propose a ranking system that recommends products that provide, on average, the best value for the consumer's money .
 The authors use a unique data set of U .
S .
 hotel reservations made over a three-month period through Travelocity, which they supplement with data from various social media sources using techniques from text mining, image classification, social geotagging, human annotations, and geomapping .
 They propose a random coefficient hybrid structural model, taking into account the two sources of consumer heterogeneity the different travel occasions and different hotel characteristics introduce .
 Based on the estimates from the model, they infer the economic impact of various location and service characteristics of hotels .
 They then propose a new hotel ranking system based on the average
