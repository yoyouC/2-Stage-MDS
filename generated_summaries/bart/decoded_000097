@cite proposed an integrated graph approach to represent the contextual relationships among sentences of all the input documents .
 These sub-graphs consist of sentences that are highly relevant to the query and that is highly related to each other .
 A scoring model is then ranked by a scoring model .
 @cite introduced a system called QueSTS, which generates a query-specific extractive summary of a selected set of documents .
 The integrated graph is then intelligently combined to produce the final summary .
 This approach greatly reduces the computational complexity .
 In this paper, we propose an extractive summarization method which leverages the semantic information in existing sentence embedding spaces .
