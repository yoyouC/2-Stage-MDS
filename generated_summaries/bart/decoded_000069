Recently, deep learning has been applied to image synthesis and manipulation @cite  .
 In this work, we use a deep neural network to decode a full-size secret image into a container image of the same size .
 This method is inspired by recent progress on natural image statistics that can be well represented by examples .
 In this paper, we propose a steganalysis technique which achieves complete recovery of the embedded secret image from a noisy observation of an encoded message .
 In addition, our method can be used as an attack model against an arbitrary embedded-based digital watermarking algorithm against which the security level is evaluated .
