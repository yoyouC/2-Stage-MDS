There have been several attempts to extend the OpenAI Gym Wrappers concept to MARL scenarios .
 @cite , the authors present an interface that can be embedded into any mobile device .
 However, these interfaces are not designed for MARL environments .
 In contrast, we provide a modular design, which can be concatenated and combined in two ways .
 First, the interfaces can be combined into a single modular design .
 Second, the interface can be integrated into any MARL platform .
 For example, in the recent work of @math , @math and @math are embedded into a mobile device, respectively, and the interfaces are designed to support self-play RL and cooperative-competitive hybrid MARL .
