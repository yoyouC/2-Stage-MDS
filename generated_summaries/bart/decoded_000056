@cite proposed a fast and efficient convolutional neural network, ESPNet, which is efficient in terms of computation, memory, and power .
 The network can process high resolution images at a rate of 112 and 9 frames per second on a standard GPU and edge device, respectively .
 However, the performance of ESPNet is only 8 times smaller than the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation network PSPNet, while its category-wise accuracy is still 8 less .
 Moreover, the efficiency of the network is limited by the number of layers and the memory requirement of the GPU .
 Semantic segmentation can be divided into two main categories .
 The first category is based on CNNs @cite  .
 The second category consists of deconvolution and unpooling layers, which are trained end-to-end for semantic segmentation .
 In the first category, the deconvolutions are used to extract features from the input image, and the unpooled layers are used for classification .
 The second class consists of the fully convolutional layers and the fully-connected layers .
 The deconvvolution layers can be used for image super-resolution (SR), which is a challenging task due to the high computational complexity .
 Semantic segmentation has been a long-standing research problem in computer vision .
 Early works in semantic segmentation are mainly based on hand-crafted features @cite  .
 Recently, deep neural networks have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, such as image segmentation, object detection and segmentation .
 In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for image semantic segmentations .
 In the field of computer vision, deep CNNs have achieved impressive results in many vision tasks such as object detection, segmentation and image captioning .
 In this paper, we focus on the segmentation of thermal infrared images .
 Semantic segmentation has been extensively studied in the past few years .
 In @cite , the authors proposed a two-layer hierarchical Conditional Random Field (HCRF) to jointly predict depth and semantic segmentation .
 The authors also proposed a unified framework for joint depth prediction and semantic label prediction .
 In this paper, we propose EC-CNN to adaptively incorporate edge prior knowledge and adaptively integrate edge prior prior knowledge in the segmentation process .
 In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset named "Segment Objects in Day And night"(SODA) for comprehensive evaluations in thermal infrared segmentation, which contains 20 semantic region labels .
