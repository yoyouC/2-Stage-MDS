Game-theoretic characterization of bisimilarity games has been a long-standing research topic in computer science and game theory .
 Early works on game characterization include @cite , @math , and @math  .
 In particular, @math is defined as the number of states in the state space of a system that can be represented by a set of predicates .
 @math denotes the set of states of the system that are used to determine the state of the state .
 In contrast, our definition of codensity is defined in terms of fibrations, coalgebras, and fibrational predicate transformers .
 Game theory has been applied to a wide range of computer games, ranging from simple games @cite to voting systems (e .

, voting systems) .
 In particular, games have been studied in the context of voting systems, where each player chooses a route from the origin to the destination, which is common to all players .
 In the case of simple games, the goal is to maximize the total cost of a player's route, which can be measured by the sum of the costs of the road segments in his route .
 In this paper, we focus on game characterizations of bisimilarity in terms of bisimulation metric .
 Bisimilarity games have also been studied in the context of probabilistic processes @cite  .
 For example, in the case of @math and @math , @math can be defined as the smallest epsi such that @math is @math -equivalent to @math  .
 In the case @math there are countably many labels, which is the same as the case for @math (see e .

 for a more detailed discussion) .
 In this paper, we extend the notion of bisimilarity in terms of fibrations and coalgebras to a general categorical game characterization .
 Game-theoretic characterization of bisimilarity games has been an active area of research in the past few years .
 In @cite , the authors use coalgebras as fibrational predicate transformers for organizing predicates in a game .
 In particular, they use the morphisms of fibrations as well as canonical liftings of functors via Kan extensions .
 The authors also use fibration as a general categorical framework for bisimulation notions in control theory .
 In this paper, we extend bisimulations to a variety of games, including Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) @cites , Markov Network Configuration (M2C) systems, and Probabilistic Decision Processs (P
