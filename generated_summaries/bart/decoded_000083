In @cite , the authors proposed a novel fuzziness based semi-supervised learning approach by utilizing unlabeled samples assisted with supervised learning algorithm to improve the classifier's performance for the IDSsss .
 The authors proposed an intrusion detection model based on deep belief network (DNN) and a sample categorization (low, mid, and high fuzziness categories) based on the fuzzy quantity of the data .
 The proposed approach uses a single hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN) to output a fuzzy membership vector .
 The classifier is retrained after incorporating each category separately into the original training set .
