Group activity recognition has been extensively studied in the literature .
 @cite proposed a multi-task dialogue model for group activity recognition .
 They proposed to encode the group-activities with three types of localized causalities, namely self-causality, pair-causesality, and group-casusality .
 They encoded the local interaction reasoning relations within, between, and among motion trajectories of different humans respectively .
 They also proposed a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning approach to learn a dialogue manager that operates at different temporal scales .
 In this work, we focus on the task of group action recognition in surveillance videos .
 Group activity recognition has been extensively studied in the past few years .
 In @cite , the authors proposed a fuzzy rule-based approach to recognize group activities .
 They divided the state space into several fuzzy subspaces .
 The consequent part of the fuzzy if-then rules is a motion vector that suggests the moving direction and velocity of the learning agent .
 The proposed method is insensitive to small noise since an orderlet only depends on the comparative relationship among individual features .
 However, it is not suitable for real-time online action recognition since it is sensitive to noisy information .
 In this paper, we propose a novel method to progressively refine the low-level features and high-level relations of group activity recognition .
