NMT @cite is a cross-lingual language model to extract cross-lingual language models for NMT. 
 It is trained on a dataset with a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a decoder layer to learn the classifier. 
 In this way, we are interested in the following section. 
 We also use monolingual data with RNN trained in our experiments. 
 We demonstrate that our approach is more effective than ours, since we focus on cross-lingual language generation for the task of monolingual languages and do not consider the use of monolingual data as we do in this paper. 
 In addition, we show that this is the best of our work. 
 We show that our method is more general and more and more general data augmentation than cross-lingual and monolingual models and cross-lingual BLEU), BLEU), and cross-lingual BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), and and and and and and and and and and and and BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), BLEU), monolingual and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and BLEU), monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual monolingual
