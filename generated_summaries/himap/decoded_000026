In @cite , the authors propose a differentially private ADMM (P-ADMM) to provide dynamic privacy in the data mining phase. 
 The authors of @cite proposed a privacy-preserving algorithm for privacy preserving data based on the assumption that the data is insensitive to the number of nodes. 
 The authors in @cite consider the problem of finding the privacy of the data from the data set and the privacy error. 
 In this paper, we consider the privacy problem as an optimization problem. 
 In our work, we assume that the private data can be used to generate the most sensitive information of the service in the presence of a group In our approach, we do not need to be able to find the optimal privacy protection for a given data access to the most of the service In this work, we focus on the more general privacy preserving privacy losses for the data mining while our work is different from the one in @cite , in which the authors use a similar approach in @cite to derive the optimal solution of the privacy protection in a privacy-preserving manner. 
 In our paper, we use the same approach as the previous work of @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose a framework for privacy-preserving privacy based on PINQ and Airavat, @cite for the purpose of online privacy systems. 
 However, their work focuses on the privacy of the privacy and the privacy protection of the network. 
 In this paper, we focus on the problem where the server is assumed to be tracked In our work, we consider the problem of privacy losses in the presence of disjoint and show that it is not possible to achieve the optimal privacy protection for a single node that is not available in the real world. 
 However, in this work, we propose a novel framework that can be used to provide the privacy protection in the case where the user is to maximize the sensitive information of the data point at the same time. 
 In our paper, we do not consider the effect of privacy protection and privacy protection as the benefit of our approach is to be able to achieve a better performance of the performance of this problem. 
 In addition, we show that our approach can be applied to the online setting where the number of data point is not necessarily the same as we do. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a privacy-preserving framework for learning the utility of a privacy-preserving rate-distortion problem in a distributed randomization setting. 
 The authors of @cite proposed a privacy-preserving noise-adding information leakage for privacy and model The authors show that the ADMM algorithm is able to find the optimal correlation between the two sensitive information and the utility function. 
 In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the optimal mapping between the user's correlation and the privacy protection of the adversary in order to reduce the number of sensitive information. 
 In addition, our approach is based on the assumption that the maximal correlation function is perturbed into a mutual cost function which is not applicable to the privacy problem. 
 In our work, we assume that the utility function can be used in a convex manner without the need to be extended to the case of privacy and privacy @cite @cite @cite , which can be viewed as a special case of ADMM @cite @cite . 
 In our approach, we do not require any assumption on the utility function, which is the focus of our work. 
 Our approach is more closely related to this work. 
 However, we focus on the use of differential privacy.
