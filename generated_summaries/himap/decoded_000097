In this paper, we focus on the problem of sentence embedding which is related to the task of extractive summarization @cite @cite @cite . 
 In this work we aim to represent the summary of the extractive extractive summary of a collection of documents. 
 Our work differs from these previous works in that the goal is to generate a set of sentences from a given set of documents. 
 In our work, we assume that the sentences are represented as a graph or a summary of an image is available. 
 Our approach is similar to that of @cite , where it is used as a summary to minimize the similarity between the ground truth and the ground truth. 
 This is the same as the graph method @cite , which uses a dense graph structure to compute the similarity of sentences in the document embedding. 
 We are not interested in the form of the French model, which is not available in the present paper. 
 In fact, the method is not able to capture the coherence between sentences in a collection and in the sense that it is not clear how to be used in a single graph that is not better
