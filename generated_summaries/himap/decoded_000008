In @cite , the authors propose a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach to model the reward of a dialogue manager and a region proposal mechanism to improve the performance of the system. 
 In this paper, we explore the use of deep reinforcement learning for text search generation. 
 In our work, we also use a similar approach, but instead is more flexible and more than more than a single dialogue policy for the dialogue simulation. 
 In contrast, our model is able to learn a dialogue policy that is not able to complete the dialogue manager into a single face search task. 
 In this work, we show that our approach is more effective for dialogue recognition tasks and not only applicable to the dialogue setting. 
 The main difference between our work and theirs is that we do not require any supervision of the dialogue policy and do not consider the problem of learning a new dialogue policy to be used for a given dialogue policy in the dialogue dialogue.

 User-generated and interdisciplinary @cite propose a ranking system that can be used to generate information created from social media data. 
 They propose a frame-based ranking system based on the average utility function and a random walk gain to generate products of products in a single product characteristic dimension @cite . 
 This approach is similar to ours in that we focus on the problem of social media and does not require any user knowledge about the hotel nor service characteristics of the hotel and service characteristics of hotels. 
 Our work is complementary to that of @cite , but we do not focus on any ranking system and is not applicable to the text ranking engines of @cite . 
 In this paper, we propose a new ranking system for social media search based on star dialogue management engines in the context of text search and information retrieval engines in a frame-based AI system as well as in @cite . 
 The main difference between these two approaches is the lack of the number of consumer and different hotel queries. 
 which is the main focus of this paper. 
 In @cite , the authors proposed a random coefficient system for ranking and service behavior in the presence of hotels.
