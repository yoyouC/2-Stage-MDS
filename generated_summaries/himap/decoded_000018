In this paper, we focus on the problem of unconstrained face alignment in a single manner, which is more closely related to our work. 
 The closest work to ours is @cite , which proposed to learn a voxel shape from a single image using a collection of parametric models. 
 Our method differs from theirs in two aspects. 
 First, our method is based on a combination of the 3D and the approaches. 
 We do not use any similar approach, but we do not assume that the shape is a small number of images in our work. 
 Second, the shape of the 3D shape is not always the same as the input of the image is in The difference between our work and theirs is that we are interested in learning the shape space of the shape rather than the shape and the shape as the input. 
 The difference is that our method does not require any additional information about the input and hence it cannot be used to train the 3D shape <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> 3D al @cite proposed a generative model for 3D shape generation using a deep neural network based on the shape of the 3D shape image. 
 Surfaces and test-set @cite used a recursive neural network to predict the topology of a 3D shape and then perform 3D shape images into a single set of 3D objects. 
 In @cite , the authors present an approach for learning the topology and structure of 3D shapes in a unified framework. 
 However, their method is not suitable for mesh classification, which is the focus of our work. 
 However, we focus on the use of deep convolutional neural networks in the context of 3D shape estimation, which is a challenging problem in the sense that it does not need to learn a 3D representation of the input image and is able to capture the 3D 3D structure of a given image with a large number of objects in the image. 
 Our work is also related to @cite @cite @cite , which can be used to generate 3D shapes from a single image to a single 3D shape image and then use the learned representation of 3D objects as well as an image to classify the surface into a 3D domain @cite . 
 unit al @cite proposed a method to represent 3D shapes from 3D shapes using the eigenvalues of the 3D diffusion operator. 
 They use diffusion as a post-processing step for classification. 
 In their work, they show that the diffusion and eigenvectors of the shape can be inferred from the shape of a shape collection in the shape space. 
 They also showed that this method can be applied to the problem of 3D shape generation and shape estimation @cite . 
 However, the method in @cite is similar to that of @cite @cite @cite , which are based on isometric consistency between the input image and the shape collection of the diffusion shape and eigenvectors are used for the final parsing of the discrete shape collection and the final structure of the diffusion in order to obtain the final shape similarity between the shape and the target image. 
 We show that our method is more effective in this paper, but our approach is based on a combination of 3D structures and point translation and eigenvectors as well as a diffusion distribution of the diffusion operator. 
 We propose a novel method that can be used to generate shapes of shapes in a collection of matching Matching al @cite proposed a method to recognize 3D shapes of a 3D shape using a 3D mesh model from a single image. 
 They then use a CNN to predict the positions of an object in a given image. 
 Their approach is similar to ours except that it is based on a combination of the volumetric and the features of the SCAPE model and soft with part the while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, while, Meshes Meshes Meshes Meshes Meshes Meshes Meshes Meshes while, while, while, at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at at and PASCAL3D
