In this section, we briefly review the related works that are related to our work. 
 We refer readers to @cite @cite @cite and @cite . 
 Here, we focus on the use of deep learning to predict the entire point cloud in a single single point cloud @cite @cite . 
 Our work differs from the previous works in that it is based on a combination of the and DensePCR @cite , which is an extension of the @cite , and has been successfully applied to a wide range of computer vision applications such as image classification @cite , object detection @cite @cite , image synthesis @cite @cite , <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In this paper, we focus on the problem of point cloud detection in a single manner, while our work is related to @cite @cite @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose to use a CNN to predict the entire point cloud to generate a dense point cloud in which the point cloud is composed of the 3D point cloud and the 3D 3D point clouds is used to obtain the final point cloud for each point cloud with the goal of minimizing the 3D pose. 
 In @cite @cite , we propose a variational method to generate point clouds from a single 2D point cloud which can be used to learn the global descriptor in the point cloud. 
 In our work, we use a similar approach in @cite which is similar to our proposed method in that we do not require any extra information about the point clouds and the second part of this method. 
 In contrast to @cite , our method is based on a combination of the voxel and the graph-based loss @cite , which is the first work to exploit the structure of point clouds for point cloud reconstruction in the context of point clouds. 
 2D al @cite proposed a convolutional network based approach to detect the entire point cloud in a single image for a given image. 
 This work is based on the idea of 3D reconstruction of 3D point cloud and the alignment detector @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the problem of point cloud reconstruction in the presence of a point cloud rather than a single point cloud image. 
 We also use the alignment and attention mechanism in our experiments in order to improve the performance of OctNet in the context of point clouds and achieve better performance on the reconstruction of high-resolution images. 
 We propose a novel method which can be used as a post-processing step for generating point cloud cloud reconstruction and point cloud matching as well as in the case of plenoptic point clouds @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a low-resolution 3D representation of the point cloud to be used for point clouds to obtain the final point cloud for a single image. 
 Our method is similar to that of @cite @cite . 
 We focus on a more challenging task where the point is not a point of view, but is not applicable to our problem.
