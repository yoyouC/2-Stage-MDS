In @cite , the authors study the problem of directed interaction managers in order to investigate the dialogue skills in the course of social networks. 
 The authors of @cite propose a dialogue manager based on neural network models to estimate the dialogues of Twitter users in the network. 
 In their model, they found that dialogue managers can be used as a Bayesian model for a conversational avatar where the users have access to the US, of the conversations. 
 In this work, we found that the dialogue manager is not the case of social networks that are matched to the US, Spain, of the social network in the US, and the UK, Spain, @cite . 
 The study of dialogue and track", @cite showed that it is possible to handle the quality of Twitter and voters as well as the number of users and the user to the user. 
 In this paper, we focus on the Ubuntu dialogue managers and show that it can be applied to handle social networks with similar results. 
 In our work, we do not consider the effect of social capital and voters that are not comparable to the dialogue but they do not address the issue of the dialogue
