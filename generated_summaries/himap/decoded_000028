In @cite , the authors propose a method for solving the problem of illuminant estimation in the discretization of barcodes in order to describe the sparse color of the graph to the color of a bipartite graph @cite . 
 It is based on the assumption that the adjacency matrix can be used as a special case of the conjugate matrix of the graph mesh an Cholesky Cholesky Cholesky quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation , Time , bandwidth gradient barcodes (2-D) bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation quadrangulation bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth bandwidth ). 
 In this paper, we focus on the recent work of stochastic and nodal @cite , which aims to solve the sum of the sparse triangular solver, and backward substitutions in the parallel solver, a Cholesky and backward substitutions as well as in @cite . 
 The authors of @cite propose a parallel ordering method to achieve the sparse convergence of a finite set of smooth functions, which can be viewed as a generalization method for the block multi-color problem. 
 However, the method in @cite does not require any assumption that the block is assumed to be strongly In our work, we propose a new block multi-color method which can achieve the convergence rate of block multi-color in a parallel manner. 
 In our paper, we consider the problem of block ordering and nodal convergence of the block and backward thread matrices for the parallel triangular solver, which is also used in our method. 
 The proposed method can be used in the framework of @cite , where the authors proposed a method based on block multi-color multi-color multi-color and backward substitutions to achieve a more robust convergence rate. 
 However, our method is based on a hierarchical block multi-color and the backward method @cite .
