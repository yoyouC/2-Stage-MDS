In this paper, we focus on the problem of person ReID in the presence of a single image image with a single camera input. 
 We use this idea in the context of person re-ID and show that it can be applied in a more challenging task for person ReID @cite @cite @cite . 
 In this work, we propose a novel deep learning framework that can be used to train a discriminative model for person re-identification @cite , which is also used in our previous work @cite . 
 We will not introduce our work in this area. 
 In @cite , the authors proposed to learn a discriminative representation of the person and body of the image in an unsupervised manner. 
 However, we use the feature map to learn the optimal distance between the matched and body parts of the training set, which is the focus of our work. 
 Our work is complementary to these approaches in the sense that we do not require any additional information about the training data but do not consider the temporal information of the camera in the image and thus do not have the impact on the person structure in the image. 
 In our work, we use a cross-view distance metric which can be viewed as a special case of the feature extraction problem in @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the person re-identification problem in the person domain. 
 The proposed method is more closely related to the one we present in @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose to use a CNN to predict the person structure of a person and a sequence of human regions in a unified framework. 
 However, their method is based on the assumption that it is not necessary to learn the color image. 
 In contrast, our method is able to improve the performance of person re-ID and person re-identification problem. 
 @cite proposes a deep neural network for person re-identification using a recurrent neural network to jointly learn the global full-body structure of the input image and the input image.

 We briefly review previous works related to the person re-id problem. 
 In our work, we focus on the related related work on person re-id @cite @cite @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose to use a CNN to predict the most discriminative video structure and then select the frames from the input image to generate the final person to a person pose. 
 In this paper, we propose an end-to-end learning model based on the previous work of @cite , which proposed a novel deep learning model to learn a discriminative feature representation based on feature representation and feature representation for person re-id task. 
 @cite proposed a deep neural network to learn the global and global cues in the person bounding box dataset @cite proposed to use the attention mechanism to extract the person body part of the person image and the person image. 
 In @cite @cite , person re-id is used to generate a global feature map for each person to be used for person re-identification. 
 Person @cite proposed an end-to-end attention mechanism for person re-identification using a deep convolutional neural network @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose a method to learn a stable representation of the person image and the person structure of a person image. 
 The authors also proposed a framework called Cross-view @cite , where the authors used a distance function to predict the occurrence of a pair of images in the image. 
 This work was extended to the person ReID problem by Local al @cite , which is based on a combination of GAN and metric learning to learn the global feature representation for person re-identification. 
 However, the work in @cite only considers the problem of person re-ID and does not require the assumption that we are able to generate a large number of pairs of images and are not able to capture the performance of a given image. 
 In addition, our method is able to learn both discriminative and local feature maps for the task of ReID @cite @cite @cite . 
 In our work, we propose a novel metric learning method that can be used to generate the person re-ID model using a discriminator network. 
 In this paper, we propose an end-to-end distance learning method based on the maximum relative distance between the matched and local features.
