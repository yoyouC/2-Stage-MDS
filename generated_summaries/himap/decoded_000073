In @cite , the authors present a framework for text bisimilarity using the combination of bisimilarity in the context of game theory. 
 The authors of @cite proposed an approach to estimate the bisimilarity of agents in a multi-layer environment. 
 They are able to find a small number of logic games that are relevant to each other. 
 However, the main drawback of this approach is that the model parameters is limited to the number of agents and not only a small portion of the data. 
 In contrast, our approach is able to improve the performance of the bisimilarity and the game is not applicable to the current of the game and the current In this paper, we propose a new framework for text analysis which is similar to the one proposed in this paper. 
 However, we focus on the study of game games which are more likely to be available in the case of the current game segment and the current strategic behavior of the action space. 
 Furthermore, the bisimilarity in @cite is based on the observation that the bisimilarity are generated by a categorical predicate and the action is used as a categorical to evaluate the action selection process. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a general framework to determine the strategy of the bisimilarity in the Spring game. 
 In this paper, we use the idea of @cite to the problem of route selection in a single categorical In our case, we are able to provide a complete framework for route games in which we are interested in the form of a categorical game game characterization of the opponent. 
 game. 
 We will show that this approach can be applied to the case where the number of players who is a set of route functions is guaranteed In our work, we do not assume that the bisimilarity is guaranteed in the case of the opponent or the neighbors of the opponent. 
 In contrast, we focus on the use of bisimilarity simulation and the opponent metric of the bisimilarity game bisimilarity play and Duplicator @cite propose a method that is based on the fact that it is possible to achieve the optimal utility of the road segments of the opponent. 
 player. 
 We also note that this is not the case for the bisimilarity that it can be used as an alternative to our framework of @cite , which is also discussed in @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the behavioral distance between states in a Markov process and use the algorithm to find the states of the bisimilarity in the category of bisimilarity. 
 In @cite the authors present an algorithm that can be used to compute the behavioral characterization of the @math bisimulation @math , where @math is the number of states of @math . 
 In this paper, we show that @math and @math are probabilistic versions of the same problem in @math . 
 We also show that our framework can be seen as a special case of Theorem , but it does not hold for any @math , which is not the case of the bisimilarity of the bisimilarity construction. 
 @math , as well as in @cite ). 
 Moreover, the results in @cite are more general than the and Duplicator games and Duplicator @cite . 
 In the present work, we provide a polynomial time @math for the case @math , and show that the logical characterization of bisimulation @math is a polynomial function for the bisimilarity @math and the lifting problem in @cite . 
 Note that our result is not applicable to the general setting of probabilistic and bisimulation, @cite . 
 Bisimulation and Hermida @cite proposed a deep reinforcement learning approach to jointly learn state representations and action embeddings for game players. 
 The authors focus on bisimilarity based on the Hausdorff state of the game states. 
 In @cite , Kan and Hermida presented an approach for learning control policies using stochastic two-player games. 
 They used the bisimilarity of the bisimilarity as a categorical game that is used to predict the semantics of the MDP. 
 This approach has been applied to the problem of game games @cite @cite @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the problem that can be represented as a kind of bisimilarity in terms of the Hausdorff MDP. 
 In our work, we propose a novel framework for MDPs with the goal of learning the state of a player in the original MDP @cite . 
 Our work is also closely related to @cite @cite , in which the authors proposed a general framework of MDPs bisimilarity in @cite , which is not applicable to the game game notions.
