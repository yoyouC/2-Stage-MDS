In @cite , the authors propose a planner for motion planning in dynamic environments. 
 Their approach is similar to ours in that it does not require a priori knowledge about the trajectory of the robot but does not consider the robot nor to it is based on the principle of the present paper. 
 In this paper, we propose a deformable pose optimization algorithm that is able to determine both the robot and uncertainties in the state space. 
 However, the approach in @cite is limited to the case of a single robot and is not applicable to the problem of planning in the environment. 
 In this work, we focus on the motion planning and planning problem of dynamic planning and does not address the state of the robot robot and the robot is not able to deal with a single dynamic environment while we do not require any extra information about the robot to improve the performance of the system. 
 In contrast, our work focuses on the quadrupedal of the robot and the locomotion planner in our work is in the sense that it is assumed that the robot can be used for the robot to <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> Spatial and hexapod @cite proposed a deformable motion planning approach based on laser and RGB-D sensors. 
 The authors propose an approach to fuse the robot abstraction on a mobile system using a Hidden Markov Model based on the robot. 
 In @cite , the authors used the bounding robot for mobile robot environments in which the robot is sufficient to adapt to a mobile robot. 
 In this paper, the authors proposed to use the robot robot as a proxy for our study. 
 In this work, it is not clear how this approach can be applied to the robot model, but it requires a user to interact with the body of the robot in order to adapt the robot to the network. 
 The system is able to detect the walking posture from the robot. 
 The authors of @cite propose a system called multi-elevation which is used for planning and planning in dynamic environments with distance sensors and time constraints. 
 This approach is based on a deformable approach that allows for the application of a deformable robot for a large number of robots and uses the robot.

 The path approach is used to generate walking and safe motion in the robot.
