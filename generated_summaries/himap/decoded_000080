Binary and constricts @cite proposed a keypoint invariant descriptors to estimate the color of objects in the image. 
 They then detect the keypoints into a set of sample points and then photometric transformations, respectively. 
 Descriptor and constricts @cite show that matched descriptors are more accurate than the and the @cite . 
 Binary al @cite and by al @cite used invariance and constricts @cite , and @cite . 
 These methods are complementary to our work in terms of color and motion estimation in the presence of a large number of objects and have not been used for image matching @cite @cite @cite , but it is not clear how the use of color information is not available in the case of FREAK @cite @cite . 
 In contrast to these methods, our approach is based on the assumption that the color descriptors are known to be more and thus the descriptors of the color are not necessarily the same as in @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , the authors propose a keypoint descriptor based on Morphological operators to reconstruct plausible images from different viewpoints. 
 This approach has been successfully applied in the context of image matching @cite @cite , image captioning @cite @cite and FREAK @cite @cite . 
 In particular, the authors of @cite proposed a CNN based approach to model the performance of the image in the descriptors, and the execution of the BRIEF is not considered. 
 However, their method is not suitable for the problem of matching the parameters of the descriptors, which is the main focus of our work. 
 Our approach is more general and can be applied to the FREAK setting where the information is not available and does not require any training data to be used for image classification. 
 We also propose a method based on the function of human and constricts @cite . 
 We use the same idea in @cite and @cite , where the patches are learned from a single point of view, and the second stage is trained on a single set of sample points. 
 We show that our approach can be used to improve the quality of the performance and the result of LBDs. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a keypoint descriptor descriptor based on Morphological operators to extract features from the human visual system to the human coined the cascade Keypoint Retina Keypoint Keypoint Keypoint Descriptor Descriptor (MREAK) Keypoint which can be used to detect and embedded features in a retinal sampling pattern. 
 However, their method does not require any additional knowledge about the keypoints that are more complex than the number of sample points and the amount of keypoints is not available in the system. 
 Moreover, it is not robust to FREAK FREAK pupil descriptor because it does not contain any keypoints that must be more efficient than the other light. 
 the goal of this paper is on the scope of this paper. 
 The authors of this work can be viewed as an extension of our work in the sense that it is based on the combination of binary strings and keypoints which is similar to our cascade sampling inspired by our work. 
 However, we do not consider the problem of matched keypoints and keypoints in the presence of keypoints that have not yet been considered in our work. 
 The authors in @cite have shown that keypoints can be more effective than FREAK Binary al @cite proposed a keypoint subtraction method based on Morphological operators to detect moving objects in a background model, and use a binary binary descriptor to detect the moving pixels in the current image and a background model. 
 The descriptor subtraction method is used to identify the color of the image in the image. 
 However, their method does not scale well with colors that are more likely to be available. 
 In this paper, we use a small number of features which are not related to our approach, as we will show in Sec. 
 , which is not the same as we use in this paper, but we do not require any additional assumptions on the training data in order to improve the performance of background subtraction in feature space and the use of binary feature maps to detect and match the keypoints in the background model, which is more difficult to our task. 
 In contrast, our work is more general and more than the method of background and constricts al @cite . 
 Our work is also related to the background of background @cite , which uses the morphological and constricts features for background subtraction and FREAK responding
