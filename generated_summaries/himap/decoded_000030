In @cite , the authors propose a graph-based algorithm to solve the problem of motion planning in dynamic environments. 
 The work in @cite proposed a approach to find a collision-free trajectory of the obstacle in a simulated robot using a partial motion planner, called the @cite . 
 However, the authors assume that the environment is assumed to be beneficial In our work, we consider the problem in the presence of multiple paths and show that it can be used to find the optimal trajectories of the robot in a dynamic environment without the need to be able to move the robot to the environment in order to achieve the environment with respect to the remaining tasks of the environment @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the dynamic environment where the robot trajectory is not in the scope of this paper. 
 However, the focus of this work is on the environment of the robot in the dynamic obstacles. 
 In our paper, we consider a more general problem than the robot that has the same trajectories as the environment to be beneficial In our approach, we do not require any additional information about the robot and do not consider the environment for the environment and we show in our work. 
 Hierarchical and gap'' @cite proposed a graph-based approach to compute the path between the two trajectories in the robot and the robot using the local algorithm. 
 The work in @cite proposed an algorithm based on the concept of a shortest shortest paths in a Gaussian process @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors propose an algorithm that is able to find the optimal subset of the candidate trajectories in a 2D robot to minimize the number of paths in the network. 
 However, the approach is not suitable for the case of a single robot in which it is not known that the path of the path is not guaranteed. 
 In this paper, we consider the problem of adaptive path planning in the presence of multiple possible paths and show that it is possible to achieve the optimal performance of the problem in multiple dynamic environments with the goal of minimizing the optimal trajectory of the robot in order to obtain the optimal path to be made In our approach, we do not assume that the robot is assumed to be known to be a valid of the robot In this work, we focus on the motion of the graph In this paper, we focus on the problem of robots that can be used for the environment in @cite , where the goal is to find solutions for multiple homotopy classes of the environment and show that the robot is not able to control the robot to the environment to the user. 
 In this case, our work is related to that of @cite , @cite , and @cite . 
 The main difference is that our approach is based on the assumption that a graph is a graph with the number of paths in the network, which is not suitable for our setting as well. 
 In this work, we do not assume that the graph is not more at the same time, but this is due to the fact that it is not clear how the robot can be more in order to make the environment with a single robot @cite @cite @cite . 
 Our work differs from the existing works in that it does not require any knowledge about the robot nor the environment is not in nor the number of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank>
