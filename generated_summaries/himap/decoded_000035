In @cite , the authors present a model for pedestrian behavior modeling based on pedestrian groups with a key difference in @cite . 
 The work of CITR al @cite and DUT @cite , was the first to investigate the collective motion of pedestrians in pedestrian behavior and pedestrian detection. 
 @cite proposed a model to predict the influence of pedestrians on pedestrians of pedestrians using pedestrian trajectories based on the social force of the pedestrian groups @cite . 
 Kalman al @cite presented a model that is able to predict pedestrians of a group of pedestrians and a term that was used for pedestrian detection. 
 In this paper, we focus on the use of pedestrian detection and pedestrian motion models for pedestrian trajectory detection. 
 In our work, we use the self-organization of the pedestrian dataset and the force dataset of pedestrian behavior in the presence of a group dataset @cite , which is also used in the literature @cite @cite @cite in the context of pedestrian detection. 
 We also use the social dataset @cite as the self-organization dataset and use it as a baseline model that can be applied to the pedestrian behavior problem. 
 The model is trained on the basis of the model of the pedestrian
