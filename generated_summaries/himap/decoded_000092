In this paper, we focus on the problem of zero-shot learning in the context of zero-shot learning. 
 In @cite , the authors proposed to learn the semantic representation of a target image and a target feature space for ZSL. 
 The goal is to predict the proper class of the image and the target dataset is used to generate the target feature maps for the target class, and the semantic information is learned to be a single image. 
 In our work, we propose a novel heterogeneous hypergraph label propagation method using the auxiliary dataset @cite . 
 In our proposed model, the authors propose a discriminative embedding model that is able to recognize the target samples in a coherent manner. 
 The authors of @cite propose a method that learns the semantic representations of the target image to the target domains, and the second stage is learned from the image feature space and the second <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In this paper, we focus on the recent work of @cite , which aims to learn the similarity between the source and target images in the target class of source images and the unlabeled data. 
 In @cite , the authors proposed a method to learn a embedding space for the unseen class of a given class of target images and then use them to measure the embedding space of the class of images. 
 The authors of @cite propose a method that learns a joint embedding space to regularise the semantic embedding space and the semantic representation of the target domain to the target domain. 
 However, the method in @cite is similar to that of @cite and @cite , in the case of zero-shot learning, the authors propose to use the intermediary model to generate the embedding space. 
 In addition, we show that our method is more effective than the hubness problem in @cite , where it is assumed that the similarity of the learned embedding space is the main difference between the two class and the class of <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In this paper, we focus on the recent work on zero-shot learning where the goal is to learn the mapping between the class attribute space and the semantic space of the unseen classes. 
 This work is also related to zero-shot learning @cite @cite @cite , which aims to learn a latent representation from the training data to improve the quality of the ZSL. 
 In this work, we propose a Wasserstein feedback model for zero-shot learning and show that it is not possible to learn discriminative representations for ZSL. 
 In contrast, our proposed method is based on the assumption that the learned features can be learned from a class of labeled data. 
 In addition, our approach is more general and can be used to model the proper mapping between classes, and thus can be easily applied to the task of zero-shot learning. 
 In addition, we show that the proposed method can be applied to zero-shot zero-shot learning tasks in the context of ZSL @cite , and it has been shown that this approach is effective to train a deep neural network to model the <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In this paper, we focus on the problem of zero-shot learning (ZSL) @cite @cite , which is based on the idea of learning a semantic embedding space from the input image to a semantic space @cite @cite @cite . 
 Our work differs from the previous works in that it does not use the supervision of the image as the semantic space to learn the semantic representation of the whole image. 
 In our work, we propose to learn a discriminative embedding function from the image feature space and the semantic embedding of the object in a ZSL framework. 
 Moreover, we propose a novel encoder which can be used to generate the embedding space for ZSL. 
 In our work we aim to reconstruct the best class of the class of unseen classes in the context of ZSL contains and show that it is not possible for the ZSL task and is not applicable to the ZSL model in @cite . 
 We also show that our approach is more effective than the one we also mentioned in this paper. 
 In addition, we show that the semantic loss can be applied to the unseen class of test classes and the decoder is not able to capture the projection of the original image. 
 In this paper, we focus on the problem of generalized zero-shot learning with the goal of learning the quality of the image and unseen classes in the image as a source of information @cite . 
 In this case, we aim to learn a calibration model that can be used to recognize the unseen classes of the same class in the training process in the form of a calibration task. 
 In contrast, our model is based on the assumption that the class of data belong to the image is semantically likely to be indistinguishable from the input image. 
 In contrast, we show that the ZSL problem can be improved by the ZSL method @cite @cite @cite . 
 We refer to @cite for a comprehensive review of the recent work in this section. 
 We will introduce our results in section . 
 We will show that our method is more effective than the one we use in this paper, and we are able to provide a good understanding of the performance performance in terms of the accuracy and the utility of the calibration model. 
 We also note that the method in @cite is similar to that of @cite @cite , but we do not aim at the training data.
