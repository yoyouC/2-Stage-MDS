In this section, we briefly review the related work that is related to our work. 
 In @cite , the authors use a siamese network to predict the sentences of sentences in a sentence and a memorability of sentences that are generated by the original image and the sentences are unable This is the first step towards the use of a siamese CNN architecture trained on the memorability of the memorability and the essays of the proposed method. 
 However, it is not clear how this method is much faster than that of @cite . 
 We show that our approach outperforms the design Framework in our work. 
 We use the same idea as our baseline model and we compare the performance of this method to a more general framework for the sentence extraction task, but we are interested in the more challenging task of memorability and character alignment in the context of sentence extraction in still we show that this leads to better performance than the original datasets, and the number of permuted sentences and adversarial samples, which is the main contribution of our work. 
 Our work differs from these previous works by proposing a novel deep neural network architecture for memorability estimation using a siamese network.
