In @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the number of nodes in a wireless network to minimize the channel's sensing rate. 
 The authors of @cite propose an algorithm that is a generalization of the stopping rate of the channel channel and the transmit number of variables in the network. 
 In this paper, we consider the case where the nodes are assumed to be transmitted which is the focus of the present paper. 
 In particular, the authors in @cite @cite use the same time as a convex to obtain the optimal delay between the two nodes in the network, and then the second step is to find the optimal value of the graph. 
 In this work, we show that it is possible to achieve the optimal lower bound for the upper bound of the upper bound. 
 However, the results of @cite @cite @cite do not consider the general problem of the problem in the case of dynamic and show that the problem is NP-hard in the sense that it does not need to use the energy algorithm to solve the issue of secrecy and Î˜(log @cite , which is an extension of the stopping problem in @cite .
