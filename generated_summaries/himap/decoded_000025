Our work is also related to the task of deep learning in neural networks @cite @cite @cite . 
 However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that aims at improving the performance of deep neural networks. 
 Our work differs from the previous work by @cite , in which the authors propose a neural network architecture trained on a single teacher network to learn a student model for a given teacher network and then learns a discriminator to predict the probability distribution of a teacher network. 
 In @cite , the authors proposed to use a deep neural network to predict a student network and learn the student network from a single network, and used the learned model to learn the spatial correlation between sensory and item features, and the results in @cite show that it is possible to achieve the optimal interaction between the student and the student network. 
 However, they do not consider the knowledge of the teacher network in order to improve the knowledge transfer of the student model. 
 In this paper, we propose a novel definition of knowledge isomorphism in the context of knowledge hidden neural networks in a supervised learning setting. 
 In this paper, we focus on the task of knowledge isomorphism of neural networks. 
 In particular, we show that our method is more effective than knowledge @cite , which is the focus of our work in this paper. 
 Our work is inspired by recent advances in deep neural networks @cite @cite @cite . 
 We use the same idea in @cite to generate knowledge isomorphism from a neural network to a recurrent neural network trained by a recurrent network that is trained on the input data and the output of a new layer in the training data to improve the performance of feature representations of neural network models. 
 We also show that this approach can be used to train a network that can be trained using a combination of feature maps and the feature maps of the network @cite . 
 Our work differs from the previous works in that it is designed to learn a model that is able to learn the knowledge of the art in a given training set of training data from the training data. 
 In addition, we demonstrate that it can be easily used to improve knowledge isomorphism in the context of the training process. 
 In this paper, we focus on the recent work of deep neural networks in the context of neural networks @cite @cite @cite , where the goal is to learn a mapping between the input image and the teacher image. 
 The output of the network is trained using a neural network that is trained to generate a sequence of words in a given image as input. 
 This allows us to train deep neural network for the purpose of deep learning. 
 In contrast to @cite , we are able to learn from a large number of training samples from the training data to improve the performance of student models. 
 Our work is also related to @cite @cite . 
 However, these works are not applicable to the problem of knowledge isomorphism and they do not consider the use of the training data. 
 In contrast, our proposed method is able to track both the teacher and viewpoint-invariant in a unified framework for the task of student classification. 
 In our work, we propose a novel definition of neural network models that can be used to model the knowledge isomorphism of a neural network. 
 Our work differs from the previous work by @cite , in which the authors use a similar network architecture and train a network to predict the distribution of the image in the network. 
 There has been a lot of interest in saliency learning from the past few years @cite @cite @cite . 
 These methods use neural networks as a way to learn representations that are similar to the ones in @cite . 
 However, these methods do not take into account the interpretability of the neural network and they do not generalize well to deep learning. 
 In contrast, our approach aims to learn a knowledge of the art in a neural network. 
 Our work is different from @cite , where the authors propose a generic neural network that can be used to train a neural network for each class of neural networks. 
 In addition, our approach is more general and can be applied to any general setting of deep neural networks in the context of neural networks @cite @cite , but it is not clear how to train deep networks with a large amount of training data and is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. 
 Our dataset can be seen as a generalization of these approaches in that we do not need to use a pre-trained network to learn the feature representation of neural network models for each task.
