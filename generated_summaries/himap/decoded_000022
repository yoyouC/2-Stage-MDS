In @cite , the authors propose a differentially private decision tree based on gradient obfuscation in the context of differential privacy. 
 This approach is based on the idea of , where the goal is to minimize the training subset of a decision tree in the random domain. 
 In order to reduce the number of parameters, the authors of @cite proposed a method to generate the training set of data distributions that is not suitable for learning the training data. 
 In this paper, we focus on the use of differential gradient descent as a differentially decision tree and show that it is not possible to achieve the optimal performance of the model in order to improve the performance of deep learning models on the training dataset. 
 In this work, we show that our approach is more effective than the @cite , which is not applicable to the case of large number of data and the other hand, we also show that this approach can be applied to the problem of differential learning in @cite , but it requires a large amount of training data to train a model that does not require any training data for the target task. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a differentially private private ADMM based on private data in order to generate a private data from the source domain to the target domain. 
 They also use a similar approach to disentangle the utility of the noise in the training set of data servers by solving the optimization problem as a function of the number of queries in the source domain. 
 The authors in @cite address the problem of differentially private data into a shallow learning framework. 
 However, their approach is based on the assumption that the data set is not necessarily the same as the data is large. 
 In this paper, we consider the problem in a more general setting with the goal of minimizing the privacy error. 
 In contrast, our method is able to detect the private data servers in the source <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , the authors propose an algorithm for privacy-preserving anonymization of the problem. 
 In their work, they use the same idea as @cite to obtain the utility of the data in the data set. 
 In this paper, we consider the problem of finding the privacy of a data point at the same time as a function of the number of output In our work, we do not consider the privacy problem as we do in this paper. 
 In particular, the authors of @cite show that the same problem of @cite is similar to the one presented in @cite , in the sense that it is assumed to be able to achieve the optimal utility in the learning process of the network. 
 In this work, we propose a new framework that can be used to improve the performance of the learning setting in terms of the utility function of a differentially private model @cite . 
 Our work is also related to the work of privacy-preserving and PATE @cite , where the authors proposed an algorithm to solve the problem in the context of differentially private systems in the presence of a large number of data sets. 
 The authors in @cite @cite use a similar approach, but they assume the existence of the data
