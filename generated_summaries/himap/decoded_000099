In @cite , the authors propose a dynamic algorithm to solve the problem of computing matrix profile for a class of Euclidean maps. 
 In contrast to the in @cite , a CNN algorithm is used to estimate the distance between the subsequences. 
 and the distance algorithm @cite propose an algorithm for computing matrix maps using a grid of Voronoi This method is similar to the one proposed in @cite . 
 However, the approach in @cite is not applicable to the time series. 
 Log-Euclidean. 
 @cite proposed a method for computing the optimal distance between subsequences. 
 and downsampling, @cite proposed an efficient distance metric based on the K-means algorithm Euclidean @cite , @cite , and @cite . 
 These methods are not applicable for the knowledge algorithm @cite @cite @cite , which can be considered as a special case of @cite @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on a more general problem where the Euclidean distance is not actually which is a different case of the time series of time series. 
 We also discuss the results of this paper in this paper, as it is also possible to obtain a good optimal distance for the distance function @cite . 
 Our work is also related to @cite , but it is based on a similar method to tensor and Voronoi In @cite , the authors propose a chunking algorithm to solve the problem of computing matrix profile for a general class of time series with and mine that and AAMP, @cite propose an efficient algorithm for computing the distance between subsequences. 
 They show that the proposed algorithm can be used to improve the performance of the proposed matrix completion method in @cite . 
 In this paper, we propose an algorithm based on the @math -means algorithm for matrix profile in which the rank-one weights are up to the time series of the subsequences. 
 In contrast, our algorithm is based on a combination of the singular vector distance and the weights of the singular matrix @math , which is not suitable for knowledge discovery in the number of time @math . 
 It is also worth mentioning that the algorithm in @cite is similar in spirit to the one presented in @cite , in which we derive the weights for the matrix @math . 
 We will refer to @cite for a more comprehensive review of the literature on matrix completion in the context of matrix profile and time search for time series. 
 We also discuss the results of this paper.
