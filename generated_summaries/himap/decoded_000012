Agent-based and ABMs @cite proposed a method to estimate the accuracy of a bus route by using a combination of parameter calibration and data mining techniques. 
 The authors show that this approach is able to achieve better performance than data assimilation compared to the previous work of @cite , which uses a resampling method for the bus route based on the estimated states of the future. 
 This approach is similar to our approach, but it is based on a method that allows us to calculate the states that can be used in the social sciences. 
 In our approach, the data can only be used for the system in order to make the accuracy more difficult to simulating in the case of model-based in that and DA. 
 @cite . 
 The bus model is used to detect the location information in the system that is used for each bus route This is the case that we are interested in the social route route that and the @cite . 
 In this paper, we use the exemplar approach for the modelling of model-based models to improve the performance of model-based predictions in the context of model-based simulation @cite . 
 We also use a similar approach in our work.
