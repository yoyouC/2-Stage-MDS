In @cite , the and Lustre presented an approach to improve the performance of MPI-IO by Client-side and Lustre @cite for collective I O systems that are based on the on and Lustre They show that the ideal linear dynamics can be used to reduce the number of processes within the same time. 
 This is achieved by the fact that there is a communication between the two nodes in the network, and the I O O O O which can be viewed as a special case of the ideal DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA DNA I I I I I I I , before the operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: operations: and the @cite . 
 filesystem and Lustre @cite proposed a design method that is based on the ideal I O system and provides an efficient implementation of the file system to provide an efficient solution for the file system that DNA and Lustre @cite propose a filesystem O O system for file I O policies and is able to achieve better performance than running
