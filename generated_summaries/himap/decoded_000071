In @cite , the authors propose a spectrum decision framework for resource allocation in cognitive radio networks. 
 The authors of @cite proposed a framework to capture the probability of colliding in a cognitive network. 
 The authors in @cite consider the problem of cooperative spectrum access to the radio network and propose a scalable spectrum sharing scheme for spectrum allocation in cooperative CRN. 
 In @cite the authors proposed an analytical framework for spectrum sensing in a distributed radio network where multiple users communicate with the spectrum of the primary transmitter in the network, and the spectrum is assumed to be erroneous However, the authors do not address the problem in this paper and show that it is not possible to achieve the optimal spectrum availability of the spectrum availability, which is the main difference of our proposed method in the sense that it does not need to consider the spectrum allocation of the network. 
 In this paper, we propose a new spectrum decision process for the spectrum decision network in which the secondary spectrum is characterized by a fixed number of transmit users and the latent correlation between the primary and the secondary Moreover, the authors of the same authors have shown that in this paper, our framework is more accurate and faster than the one we propose here. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a distributed spectrum sharing algorithm to reduce the number of users in a cellular network. 
 The authors of @cite have proposed a two-stage learning algorithm to pure spectrum access in a cognitive network. 
 The work in @cite addresses the power control problem under the assumption that the user is assumed to be uncoordinated In this paper, we propose a new spectrum maximization algorithm for the incomplete-information power control game in which the secondary user senses are used to improve the performance of the sum-rate and power level of the network. 
 In @cite the authors present an algorithm that is able to maximize the throughput of the PT and the secondary transmitter in the network. 
 However, the authors in @cite @cite consider the problem of minimizing the power consumption of the user in a distributed environment. 
 In the case of @cite the problem is solved with a binary error control scheme and the joint sparsity is used for the secondary radio users.
