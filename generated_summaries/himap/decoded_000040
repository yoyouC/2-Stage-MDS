decentralized @cite is a decentralized data marketplace that can be used to maintain honest information about the data from the data seller by the user. 
 This is the number of agents that have access to the same user to the trusted and are able to detect and execute their own data or other individuals such as the or notaries-with interacting and the @cite provide an approach for the Wibson data which can be organized as a blockchain for the privacy-preserving data marketplace. 
 and the Wibson token and blockchain-enabled smart and the Wibson token @cite . 
 They also showed that agents are not marketplace in the Wibson data and they are the most likely to be able to maintain the system that is the most data seller for a and notaries-@cite . 
 Wibson and blockchain-enabled @cite proposed an efficient cryptographic system for privacy-preserving data marketplace in which the data buyer is used to detect personal information in the trusted environment. 
 The main difference is that our approach is not suitable for private data and does not address the problem of honest anonymity of the personal information seller and the data is not available to be available in the system. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a new framework for privacy preserving data mining based on a perturbation model. 
 They do not consider the problem of data mining but require a user to specify the correlations between the data and the original data and they are able to deal with the different dimensions. 
 In our work, we focus on privacy mining in the presence of a single data set, which is based on the assumption that the sellers are guaranteed. 
 and the data is not necessarily the same as we do. 
 Our work differs in that it does not require any assumption about the data or the data but it is not always possible to the problem where there is no dimension of the data in the data set. 
 This approach is similar to our approach, as we do not assume that it is possible to perform a new set of data distributions the number of distributions and the multi-dimensional is done in the perturbation data mining and the privacy is performed by a factor of the data data mining data the data set is defined as the sum of the data records, in the data data mining data
