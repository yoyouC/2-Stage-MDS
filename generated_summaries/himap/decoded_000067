In this section, we briefly review the related work that is related to our work. 
 In the following, we present a brief overview of the most recent works in this section. 
 refer readers to our work is the work on DPM and conditional @cite @cite . 
 The main difference is that our approach is able to improve the performance of these methods in the context of document clustering. 
 We also use the variational model to discover the latent cluster structure of the question in the document and use it to predict the document structure of a document in the text space. 
 We are not aware of any prior work that applies to the more general problem of keyword classification for document clustering. 
 Our approach differs from theirs in two aspects. 
 First, we use the DPM term as we propose here, this approach is more flexible than the one mentioned in @cite , but it is based on a combination of variational and â€˜local which is similar to our approach, as we will show in Section , where the input data is used as a variational for the keyword of the text and the answer to be generated by the specified
