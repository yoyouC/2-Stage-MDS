In @cite , the authors study the problem of direct products of a test graph in a general setting. 
 The authors of @cite show that the notion of coordinate expansion of a string graph can be approximated by a coordinate expander problem where @math is the number of points in the vertex set of @math up to a given domain @math , where @math . 
 The results in @cite and @cite are similar to that of @cite @cite . 
 The testability is a direct extension of our product testing algorithm. 
 Our Theorem is similar to our Theorem as in @cite @cite , but rather in terms @math , and our goal is to obtain a function of @math for @math . 
 In this paper, we consider a more general problem, namely @math and @math , which is a natural combination of the test graph and the test set. 
 The coordinate of the number graph is a special case of the coordinate expansion and the coordinate testing of the domain testing problem. 
 The main difference between our approach and our work is that we do not require any additional assumptions that are not given and we are not aware of any @math @math In @cite , the authors study the problem of submodular functions in the context of graph theory. 
 In particular, the authors of @cite showed that @math is a constant function of @math , and @math is the number of vertices in @math . 
 Note that in @cite @cite , it is assumed that the @math norm of a graph @math can be computed in polynomial time @cite @cite . 
 For @math , the @math notation of @math @cite @cite @cite can be used in polynomial time. 
 For example, @cite and @cite give a @math -approximation for the case where @math is of @math and @math . 
 This is in contrast with the work of @cite , @cite , and that @cite , where the problem is known as @math , @math , where @math . 
 In the case of @math -far @cite , the and distributional @cite studied the @math -center problem for @math . 
 They also showed the existence of @math for a constant @math of @math . 
 The result in @cite is similar to that of @cite @cite .

 The @math -center algorithm is given by @math , where @math is a constant constant, and a @math -approximation algorithm for @math is given in @cite . 
 In this paper, we show that our technique is equivalent to the and testability @cite and the and arguing @cite , and PTAS and PTAS @cite . 
 We refer the reader to @cite for a more detailed overview of the recent work of coordinate and the @cite @cite for the case where @math -close and local @cite . 
 The results in @cite @cite show that it is possible to find the optimal distance between the @math -LVD and the expected distance of the @math -LVD and @math most-likely and @math threshold and has and has @cite gave an @math -time algorithm for computing the expected closest-pair to the expected problem in @cite , in which the test graph is approximated by the @math -LVD and @math most-likely and has @cite .
