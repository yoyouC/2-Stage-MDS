In this paper, we focus on the recent work of @cite , which aims to learn a mapping between the input image and the target image to the target domain. 
 We extend this approach to the problem of image captioning @cite , where the authors proposed a method to learn the proper mapping between regions and entities in the embedding space. 
 In contrast to the previous work, we propose to use the temporal attention mechanism to learn discriminative semantic representations for both visual and semantic instances in a unified framework @cite . 
 We note that the proposed method can be used in this work to improve the performance of zero-shot learning models. 
 In this work, we show that our approach is more effective than the proposed zero-shot learning, which is the focus of our work. 
 Our approach is based on the observation that the attention mechanism is beneficial and we are able to make the use of the structure of the input and the image as the input to the embedding space in the training phase. 
 In our work, we use the same attention mechanism proposed in @cite and @cite for the task of zero-shot learning. 
 In contrast, our proposed method is more robust to zero-shot In @cite , the authors propose to use the attention mechanism to improve the performance of the deep residual network. 
 In this paper, we propose a novel method to visualize the joint representation of images and the global dependencies. 
 However, it is not clear how to model the semantic embedding space of the model. 
 In this work, the authors of @cite proposed a method that learns a joint embedding of the channel space and a weighted sum of the class of the target image to obtain the final results.

 They proposed a method based on the linear combinations of the data manifold. 
 The authors show that the generalization of metric learning is effective and can be applied to a metric learning with a fixed margin in the instance of the instance space. 
 In this paper, we propose a novel metric learning method that can be used as a special case of the Rademacher similarity function as well as in @cite , where the metric is learned by a factor of the number of samples in the feature space of the feature space. 
 In our work, we consider the problem as a problem of metric learning, which can be viewed as a generalization of the metric module @cite , which uses a random forest-based objective function to learn the distance between the margin and the margin of the metric space. 
 This method has been successfully applied in the context of image retrieval @cite @cite @cite , and metric learning @cite @cite . 
 In this work, we focus on the use of a more general approach to learn a single metric space for each class, which is the focus of our work.
