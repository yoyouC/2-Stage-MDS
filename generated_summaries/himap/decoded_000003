There has been a lot of work in the area of syntactic structures for NLP and semantic role tagging @cite @cite @cite , and the task of NLP @cite @cite and NLP @cite . 
 In this section, we briefly review the most important and most closely related work we refer to this review reviews in section and review references on the topic of the syntactic and syntactic view of syntactic depth. 
 We refer to @cite for a review of the literature on syntactic parsing, and the discussion of our work in this area. 
 Here, we focus on the work that is closely related to our work. 
 For a detailed overview of the most recent work we review the reader to the survey papers @cite @cite . 
 We will refer to the review of previous previous studies related to the work of Markov and tagging @cite and to al @cite . 
 Here, we discuss the most relevant and most related work to the stochastic and compare them in the context of NLP and tagging of syntactic category tagging in the presence of a single syntactic corpus of the Penn Treebank.

 In this section, we review the most closely related work in @cite and @cite . 
 The main difference to our approach is that it is more general than the and we are interested in the next category. 
 The authors of @cite show that the syntactic structure of the syntactic complexity can be done by using the stochastic algorithm to generate the syntactic features of the limited depth. 
 However, their method is not suitable to be applicable for segmentation problems. 
 We use the idea of syntactic complexity metrics to generate a large number of candidate data errors as we do. 
 Our approach is based on the assumption that the segmentation is a set of syntactic depth.
