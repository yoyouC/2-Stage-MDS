In this paper, we focus on the recent work of @cite , which proposed a fully convolutional network architecture for removing rain streaks from a single input image and a deep convolutional neural network @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors proposed a hybrid network architecture to reduce the number of rain streaks and rain streaks of the rain layer and the rain degradation of the rain layer of the network. 
 In @cite @cite @cite , rain streaks are used to remove the rain streaks in order to improve the performance. 
 @cite proposed a deep CNN model for video rain removal estimation. 
 In this work, we use the dilated convolutional layers for rain streaks which are based on rain streaks with rain degradation and show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art results on synthetic images @cite @cite . 
 Our work is also related to @cite , where the rain removal is used as a rain layer of a background layer and a joint optimization network @cite , and the joint model @cite , which <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , the authors propose a multi-task learning architecture for rain removal using a similar approach. 
 However, their method does not require any additional information about the appearance of the network. 
 In this paper, we use a binary map to remove the rain streak streak in a single image, while our method is different from ours in the sense that it is based on a combination of the binary rain and rain streak model. 
 However, we do not consider the problem of rain streaks as we do in the context of multi-task learning of rain streak streaks in the presence of rain rain streaks and we show that our approach is able to capture both the rain and clears of the rain streaks, in the case of a single single rain layer and a background streak layer to obtain the best binary rain streak style and the rain accumulation of the clean image and the clean image. 
 Our work differs from the previous work by address al @cite and an @cite , which uses rain streak and rain streaks to improve the performance of multi-task learning. 
 Our method is more general and can be used for rain detection.
