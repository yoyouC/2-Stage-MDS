Sentiment and joint @cite propose a probabilistic model for sentiment lexicon based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and propose a method to capture the latent topical facets of topics in the context of a local synset summarization. 
 The authors of @cite proposed a method that is able to detect and recognize topics in multiple domains. 
 The proposed model is based on a joint model of the topics extracted from the web data. 
 The authors show that the proposed model can be used to generate the ratable opinion lexicon for the task. 
 In this work, we propose a novel generative model for the task of sentiment classification and opinion lexicon using the quantitative analysis of the glosses model in @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the use of the joint model and compare the performance of the Latent Aspect Rating Mixture model and the state-of-the-art method for semi-supervised synset classification. 
 We also show that our approach is more effective than the and opinion and opinion @cite and on @cite , which is more relevant to the aspect model of aspect and topic @cite , and the model model @cite , where the authors used a topic of the glosses model to predict whether the opinion is positive Sentiment and multi-knowledge @cite propose a method for sentiment polarity based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and joint sentiment analysis for sentiment analysis and classification. 
 Sentiment and Latent propose an approach to capture online opinion spam based on a set of manually selected topics from reviews and truthful reviews, truthful and movie @cite used a probabilistic model to predict the topics of deceptive truthful reviews, truthful and movie @cite proposed a statistical model based on Latent based which is similar to the one proposed in @cite and @cite . 
 However, they did not consider the problem of sentiment analysis in Twitter and have not been applied to sentiment analysis @cite @cite @cite . 
 In this paper, we focus on the sentiment polarity and sentiment polarity model in the context of sentiment polarity classification and sentiment analysis of the review of the sentiment model. 
 We compare the work of @cite who proposed in this paper, but we do not provide a comparison to our work in this paper. 
 However, the focus of this work is on the impact of the data in the review process. 
 Our work differs from the previous works in that it is more general and can be used to detect deceptive opinion ratings.
