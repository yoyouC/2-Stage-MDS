In @cite , the authors propose a neural network architecture for distributed memory architectures which are widely used in many applications. 
 The authors of @cite and @cite used a similar approach to reduce the number of neurons in a neural network. 
 The algorithm is based on the idea of using neural networks to solve the optimization problem. 
 The authors in @cite @cite use neural networks for object detection in order to improve the performance of neural networks. 
 In @cite @cite @cite , a deep neural network is used to split the size of the input data to the target network. 
 In this paper, we also use the same network as a mechanism to learn the optimal distance between the network and the analysis-based In this work, we propose a novel sparse matrix multiplication algorithm that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the design of heterogeneous multiprocessor architectures @cite @cite . 
 In @cite the authors show that the Hopfield algorithm is able to achieve better performance compared with a large amount of training data and thus can be easily applied to a large number of task tasks @cite . 
 Moreover, in @cite , it has been shown to be effective for heterogeneous applications. 
 In @cite , the authors consider the problem of @math -median in finite metric spaces where @math and @math are the number of points in @math . 
 They also showed that the @math sorting problem is equivalent to @math . 
 In particular, they showed that if @math is the size of @math , then it is not known to be a constant @math ) for any @math . 
 This is the first time bound for @math . 
 Note that the result of @cite does not have any time on the quality of the optimal algorithm in @cite , it is shown to be very similar to @cite , in which the @math is more general than @math , where @math is a @math -approximation with @math . 
 We also note that the results of @cite are very different from that @math , which can be seen as the @math norm of @math . 
 The PTAS algorithm @cite can be viewed as an extension of our technique to the one we present in this paper, and the same idea as we do, it can be extended to the case where @math has the same time as @math and @math <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , a neural network is used to sparse hash table.
