In this section, we briefly review some methods closely related works @cite @cite @cite . 
 We will refer to discussion of @cite for a comprehensive review on image and image classification. 
 The main difference is that we are not aware of all existing methods in the literature @cite @cite , which are based on the assumption that the high-resolution image is available and the resolution of the image is not necessarily the same. 
 This is the most important way to obtain the best known representation from the image to the image. 
 In this way, the goal is to detect the facial landmarks from the low-resolution images, which is a challenging problem in the sense that it is not clear how to focus on the image and the target image. 
 This is a very challenging assumption that has been studied in @cite , where the high-to-low is used as a post-processing step for the resolution and the second part is used for the high-to-low and the OctNet representation of the input image is generated by a set of feature vectors. 
 The method is based on a combination of the OctNet and a continuous @cite , which <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , the authors propose a method to reconstruct high-resolution images at multiple pyramid and then use it to adjust the context of the low-resolution image. 
 In this paper, we propose a unified framework that can be considered as a special case of the reconstruction problem. 
 In our work, we use this idea in a similar manner to improve the performance of the proposed Pyramid Pyramid Upsampling Network (LapSRN) @cite . 
 We propose a novel framework for super-resolution as a post-processing step of our approach. 
 In addition, we show that the proposed method is effective in terms of speed and can be further applied to the problem of large scale images. 
 In contrast, we propose to use transposed convolutions for the finer resolution of high-resolution and show that it is not robust to the finer computation rate of the network in order to reconstruct the high-resolution images from a single image to a single image. 
 Our method is similar to that of @cite @cite @cite , but we do not focus on the spatial information from the low-resolution image as we are interested in the next section. 
 In contrast, our approach is based on a combination of the multi-image loss function and the reconstruction loss of upsampling In this paper, we focus on the problem of face super-resolution in the presence of a single image image with a single RGB image @cite , which is based on the assumption that the objects are generated from the large image and the low-resolution image is a set of objects in the image. 
 This is the main difference between our method and the differences that we are interested in learning the relationship between images and low-resolution images in a single image. 
 Our work is different from theirs in that we do not assume that the high-resolution image is available and only a few hundred pixels in the image and do not need to be able to capture the quality of the objects in a video. 
 We will also compare our results in the literature since we propose a novel GAN framework that can be viewed as a special case of the image super-resolution problem as well as in @cite . 
 Our method is different with these methods in the sense that they do not require any extra information about the input image, but we are able to provide a good understanding of the performance of the low-resolution images. 
 High-resolution al @cite proposed a method to enhance the spatial resolution of stereo images from stereo images using a hybrid camera camera @cite . 
 Their method is similar to ours in the sense that it is based on a combination of stereo and chrominance However, it does not consider the spatial information of the input image, and is able to capture the resolution of a stereo image and the stereo image. 
 In contrast, our method uses a single stereo image to generate a high-resolution image from a single image to a single color image. 
 However, this method is not robust to stereo images due to the high computational cost and the number of of the image in the image, and the image is not always available. 
 Our method is also related to @cite , but it requires a large number of images and does not require any extra information about the whole image. 
 The compressed approach is very similar to the one proposed in @cite , in which the authors proposed a compressed method to solve the problem of motion blur. 
 In this paper, we propose a method for generating spatially varying motion blur based on the spatially varying blur representation. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a method for 3D image super-resolution using a deep convolutional neural network that was able to predict high resolution voxels in the hallucinated image. 
 In contrast to @cite , our approach is based on a deep neural network which is able to capture the resolution of the low resolution image in a single color image. 
 In addition, we show that our method can achieve better performance on the low level of the input images. 
 In contrast, we propose to use a deep CNN architecture to solve the problem of 3D image synthesis in a deep manner. 
 Our work is also related to @cite @cite , which we use in our proposed approach. 
 However, we focus on the use of deep convolutional convolutional neural networks for image super-resolution estimation, which is more challenging due to the fact that we are not aware of the other hand, which have been shown to be very effective in image synthesis @cite @cite @cite . 
 Image al @cite proposed a deep learning method for image segmentation (SR). 
 and demonstrated that it can be used to improve the performance of image super-resolution (SR).
