In this section, we briefly review the related work that has closely related to our work @cite @cite @cite , in which we present the most closely related work to our work. 
 In @cite , the authors present a method for the background subtraction problem based on object detection. 
 In this paper, we focus on the problem of background subtraction in the presence of a single background image with a single view. 
 Our work is different from @cite , which uses a similar approach to extract features from the background of the object in a background model. 
 We also use a neural network to predict the foreground frames in the current frame and use it to estimate the object and background in a single image to a single video with the same object as we do. 
 Our work differs from these previous works in the sense that we do not require any extra information about the object of the object. 
 This method has been used in a number of different applications such as object detection @cite @cite @cite <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> <blank> In @cite , the authors propose a method to estimate salient regions using a fully-convolutional neural network. 
 This model is used as a post-processing step for saliency detection in @cite . 
 However, the method in @cite is similar to that of @cite @cite . 
 In this paper, we are interested in the following Background which can be considered as an extension of the fully-convolutional algorithm in @cite , in which the background subtraction is used for the purpose of motion detection and energy optimization. 
 In addition, we show that it is possible to obtain the optimal consistency between the background frames and the semantic segmentation of the foreground frames in the gradient flow field of the first frame of the background in the first stage.

 In this paper, we use the background subtraction algorithm proposed in @cite , which are used in @cite to improve the performance of dynamic background subtraction and grouping of videos in a neural network. 
 In @cite , the authors propose a dynamic multi-level feature grouping algorithm for unseen videos based on the background algorithm @cite . 
 Background @cite proposed a background subtraction method based on background subtraction for background region detection and feature tracking and classification. 
 The work in @cite proposed an augmented feature tracking algorithm based on feature extraction and tracking from the video algorithm dataset @cite . 
 However, these methods are not suitable for videos with large amounts of frames and are not not robust to the problem where the current frame is not available and the background is used to reduce the number of false false positives @cite . 
 Moreover, we are not aware of any prior work in this area. 
 The first work is based on a @cite and background-subtraction @cite @cite , in which the subtraction subtraction is performed on the background frames and the grouping of the background region is used for the current task. 
 Background subtraction has been widely used in computer vision and natural language processing, such as object detection @cite @cite @cite , video summarization @cite , and so forth. 
 @cite , the authors propose a fully-convolutional approach for detecting primary objects in videos based on a neural network. 
 In @cite , a fully-convolutional algorithm was proposed to learn a mapping from the input image and the appearance of the object in the image. 
 In this work, we use the local appearance map to train the object detection and motion cues, which is used in the previous work of @cite , in which the object subtraction extracted from the previous frame is estimated by the appearance and the smoothness of the network with the whole video, which is similar to our method in @cite , but it is based on the combination of saliency maps from the whole image to the scene and is therefore not comparable to our proposed method. 
 The proposed approach can be considered as an extension of our method, which is more relevant to the one proposed in this paper. 
 However, we focus on the first work to use this knowledge of the scene in order to reduce the chance of the background region in the object and the background image.
