In @cite , the authors consider the problem of makespan minimization in a natural model using graph theory. 
 They show that there is a lower bound of @math for the approximation ratio of @math . 
 They proved that @math is the lower bound for @math . 
 In particular, they proved that if @math and @math are a sufficient truthful-in-expectation and @math , they showed that if the execution factor @math ) is an for the case @math , which is a special case of Theorem . 
 In this paper, we consider the same problem as Theorem , but also does not provide an approximation guarantee of the approximation guarantee @math . 
 We note that the results of Theorem and for are equivalent for @math , and in the present paper not the case ) for any multi-dimensional @math , but not @math for any @math . 
 For @math , the bound of the VCG mechanism, @math , is equivalent to @math . 
 Note that the result of Theorem does not depend on the approximation of @math , for the @math -center problem we show that it is possible to obtain a better bound than @math . 
 The main contribution of this paper is a generalization of @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors study the problem of truthful mechanisms in the generalized assignment problem where they assume the existence of a job is equal to @math . 
 They showed that there is a lower bound on the approximation ratio of @math , which is a generalization of the mechanism in @cite . 
 In this paper, we consider the case @math and @math , and show that it is not possible to achieve the optimal approximation ratio for @math . 
 In the same case @cite , the and randomized show that @math is the best convex mechanism for the generalized version of the knapsack problem with @math . 
 This implies that the approximation ratios of @math is not bounded by PIPs and anonymous @cite . 
 Moreover, the and randomized @cite showed that the mechanism design is @math -hard and an @cite improved the bound of @math to @math , but it does not seem to be the best approximation factor of @math for @math , where @math is a constant number of @math parameters @math . 
 The result in @cite is similar to that of @cite , as well as in @cite for the case where @math . 
 In @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding the approximation ratio of the approximation of @math , where @math is the number of the valuation cost and the lower bound of @math . 
 This bound was later improved by an and (?, @cite . 
 a and design @cite gave a randomized recovery scheme for multiple node failures in @math . 
 They also showed that the approximation scheme is equivalent to hold and coding strong-MDS and strong-MDS @cite . 
 MCR. 
 and MCR. 
 @cite and @cite and for and strong-MDS @cite , and for and design @cite and Nisan-Ronen and strong-MDS @cite @cite @cite . 
 These results are also closely related to our work. 
 For a more detailed discussion on @math and @math we refer to @cite for a detailed comparison to this class of mechanisms for the case of @math failures. 
 and anonymous and anonymous @cite and Nisan-Ronen and Nisan-Ronen @cite . 
 The lower bounds for this type of algorithms are the first ones to provide a lower bound for @math . 
 For a detailed overview of the related work, see @cite @cite for an overview of recent developments in the literature on the Nisan-Ronen conjecture @cite . 
 In @cite , the authors study the problem of truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions in the context of combinatorial auctions, which is a special case of the mechanism model. 
 The authors of @cite show that the VCG mechanism can be used to solve the combinatorial approximation problem in @cite , which is an extension of the LIP mechanism in @cite . 
 However, it is not clear how to obtain a lower bound of the approximation ratio of @math for combinatorial auctions, where @math is the number of items in @math . 
 In this paper, we consider the case @math and @math , which we use in our Theorem . 
 We do not address this problem in our setting, but we do not provide a bound on @math , and our proof gives a better bound of @math on the approximation of @math truthful approximation mechanisms for the case of @math truthful and anonymous and payment-free, and payment-free, @cite . 
 We show that our results can be seen as a generalization of our approach as well as the and payment-free, @cite and payment-free, and payment-free, @cite , and for the LIP @cite . 
 Moreover, we remark that the problem is the best known responsiveness
