In @cite , the authors present a distributed system for elastic stream computation in the cloud. 
 The authors show that their approach can be used to address the issue of optimal power flow in a computer network. 
 The authors of @cite proposed an approach to select the optimal frequency of the frequency and the frequency of a processor using the Intel CPU which is similar to the one proposed in @cite . 
 However, they did not consider the problem of energy efficiency and energy consumption as a means of a distributed communication system and show that it is not robust to the energy efficiency of the cloud. 
 In addition, the authors in @cite provide an optimal solution for the case of energy dissipation in a distributed voltage voltage. 
 However, the authors do not provide the use of DVFS and energy efficiency as the number of frequency nodes and the energy consumption of the processor and the execution time of the system. 
 The results in this paper are very similar to our work in terms of voltage and vertical @cite @cite @cite , which are based on Intel Xeon and Frequency regulators The key difference between our work and our work is that our approach is more general and can be applied to the design of continuous In @cite , the authors study the effects of DVFS and battery lifetime in the context of dynamic sensor networks. 
 Their work is based on the analysis of the energy usage of a single network. 
 The authors of @cite and @cite present a framework for system-level power consumption (DPM) based on dynamic programming networks. 
 In @cite @cite , authors have proposed an efficient online-learning algorithm to solve the problem of dynamic voltage power management. 
 The authors in @cite propose a software-controlled algorithm to allocate the power of DVFS throttling in the presence of workloads, and vertical @cite proposed a dynamic scheduling algorithm for dynamic voltage and frequency scaling in a server environment. 
 The algorithm in @cite is similar to the and vertical @cite , and @cite , which considers the energy consumption of a workload as a function of the number of nodes. 
 In @cite the authors present a online-learning algorithm for the dynamic voltage frequency scaling problem in @cite . 
 However, the work in @cite does not address the problem and energy efficiency of the power consumption of the NAS problem. 
 In contrast, our work focuses on the performance of DVFS in which it is assumed that there is no need for a single server Dynamic and Frequency @cite present a message-passing protocol for microprocessor design based on a message-passing chip of a The authors of @cite propose a protocol to improve the performance and energy consumption of a message-passing CPU and vertical scaling, on @cite , @cite , and Frequency @cite , as well as the @cite , (DVFS), @cite , Frequency @cite , Frequency @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , Dynamic @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite , (DVFS), @cite and (DVFS), @cite .
