In @cite , the authors consider the problem of finding a cluster set of vertices in an input graph, and use a parallel isolation algorithm to find the optimal vertex set of a graph in a graph. 
 The authors also proposed a global clustering algorithm based on clustering algorithm to fill the definitions of clusterings in the application of graph clustering algorithms in @cite . 
 The authors proposed global @cite , which also uses global for graph clustering and community detection algorithms for graph quality. 
 The authors of this paper can be viewed as a generalization of the global algorithms in the context of the clustering and clustering of the input graph, but they are not applicable to the problem considered here, and have also been used for clustering @cite @cite @cite . 
 We refer the reader to @cite for a more comprehensive survey of this area. 
 We refer to the survey by @cite for the more and review of the recent work of graph and the @cite and for and that @cite , for the detailed discussion of this paper. 
 We focus on the use of these methods, which are more likely to be available in our work.
