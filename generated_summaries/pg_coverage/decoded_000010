in this section , we review the most relevant work on road network extraction .
 we refer readers to @ cite @ cite for a comprehensive survey of the most comprehensive survey on the topic of remote sensing .
 in particular , we focus on the following three aspects : ( 1 ) we are interested readers to us the introduction of the aggregate extraction of the visibility distances between foggy graph, and sky ( see @ cite , @ cite and references therein ) .
 in the following sections , we are not aware of any previous work in the area of road network , which is not available in the field of the label noises .
 in this paper , we provide a brief review of the previous work on the problem of road detection in remote sensing image classification .
 in contrast to our work , we use a camera to collect the aesthetic labels of the road , and the relationships between the object and the processed image are not available .
 in our case , the extraction of semantic features has been shown to be particularly useful for detecting road networks , in the context of foggy weather conditions @ cite .
 however beyond the scope of this work , there is a large body of work that investigates the feasibility of route travel times .
 in the context of remote sensing , there has been a large body of work on the problem of road network extraction in remote sensing imagery .
 for example , @ cite proposed the use of selfish behavior in the congested network to facilitate the existence of route traffic times .
 @ cite @ cite studied the inefficiency of a large number of nodes in the graph .
 in @ cite , the authors present a theoretical analysis of the selfish behavior and all the types of queries in the size of the graph , and @ cite focused on the structure of network traffic cardinalities .
 the authors of @ cite examined the consequences of selfish routing labels to estimate closeness prices in satellite imagery .
 however , they do not consider the cardinalities of speed and route travel times .
 in contrast to our work , we assume that the distance between the geographic locations of the network and the travel time is maximized .
 in this paper , we show that our HIP approach can be seen as a special case of semantic network extraction and inference of semantic features for remote sensing of queries .
 in particular , we provide a thorough comparison of the advantages of the neighborhood cardinality of the logarithmic size .
 in the area of semantic network extraction , there is a large body of work on label sharing between satellite imagery and remote sensing .
 for instance , @ cite used semantic distance to calculate the distance between two categories .
 @ cite studied the problem of road network extraction in remote sensing , where the goal is to find the best distance between the images of the object and the graph, categories .
 in @ cite , the authors present a comprehensive survey on the edge detection of semantic features .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of these works are not concerned with the specific task of detecting speed and route travel times .
 in contrast to our work , we use a distance labeling algorithm to compute semantic distance labeling , which is not available in the context of the road network can be used to infer the travel time of the graph .
 we show that the best performing label sharing can be sped up with @ cite and @ cite .
 however indicating the labels of the category , the extraction of speed and travel time is not well suited for remote sensing imagery .
