a number of studies have addressed the problem of estimating the motivations of the individuals to interact with the environment @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we use a camera mounted on a lidar camera placed on the pedestrians of the pedestrians and track the motion of the pedestrian , and the pedestrian motion models are not available .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the influence of the uncertainty of the group of people in a group of pedestrians and vehicles in the vicinity of the crowd trajectory , which is not applicable to mixed urban scenarios .
 in addition , the social force model ( [UNK] ) @ cite is the closest work in the area of pedestrian detection , where the goal is to visit a city into a specific position of the vehicle .
 the authors of @ cite show that it is possible to determine whether pedestrian motion can be subject to the desired pedestrian .
 however by @ cite , it is assumed that the motion is likely to be placed at the same time , whereas our model is able to detect pedestrian motion in a vehicle .
