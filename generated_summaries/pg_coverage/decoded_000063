the center loss @ cite @ cite has been successfully applied to face recognition in the context of speaker recognition @ cite .
 the authors of @ cite proposed a method for speaker recognition using deep neural networks .
 in this work , we focus on the learning of the loss function for deep learning , which is a generalization of the proposed center loss .
 we use the center of the [UNK] @ cite as a measure of the difference between the classes of the class and the samples in the center , and the goal is to minimize the distance between the source and the target domain .
 in contrast to our work , our work is different from the previous work on center loss , which can be viewed as a special case of the softmax layer .
 we show that the proposed method is able to train a deep learning model for each class of softmax loss .
 in addition , we propose a novel supervision signal for speaker verification and face verification .
 we also show that it is possible to achieve state-of-the-art performance in face recognition systems @ cite , and we refer to @ cite for a comprehensive review .
