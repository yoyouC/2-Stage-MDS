there is a large body of work on subgraph isomorphism problems, @ cite and [UNK] @ cite @ cite .
 in particular , it has been studied in the context of subgraph planar graphs @ cite , and the problem of deciding whether the graph has a given graph @ math .
 the non-induced problem has been addressed in the literature , e.
g of the unsatisfiable phase transition, ( see @ cite for a survey ) .
 for instance , in @ cite the authors present a @ math -competitive algorithm for non-induced -means of @ math , where @ math denotes the @ math -th position of the input @ math and @ math is the set of size @ math @ math ( @ math ) , @ math for @ math such that the structure of the pattern @ math can be computed .
 in the case of the labels.
 problem , @ cite showed that the problem is @ math -hard , even if @ math admits a polynomial approximation @ math that runs in @ math time .
 however restrict the need to have a large number of candidates of the same size of the graph .
 the problem of subgraph isomorphism has been studied in the context of the subgraph problem.
 problem @ cite @ cite , where the goal is to find the subgraph of the diameter @ math , where @ math is the number of edges in the plane @ math .
 in @ cite the authors @ cite studied the k-vertex of the algorithm for @ math and @ math for the @ math -center problem .
 in particular , @ cite showed that @ math dof can be posed as a special case of the problem .
 however confirming the gap between the problem and the minimum number of relations lies in @ math @ cite .
 in this paper , we also refer to @ cite for a more comprehensive review of the problem, extension of the unweighted graph problem .
 we refer the reader to the monograph @ cite and its survey @ cite in the following section we cover the gaps between the following two lines of se subgraph isomorphism and subgraph isomorphism of small and medium areas .
 we summarize the most relevant work related to the present work in the area of planar networks , and we refer to our work .
 there is a large body of work on heuristic selection and signaling pathways in the context of subgraph isomorphism .
 for example , @ cite proposed an alternative to the use of a feature selection technique to identify the distances between the graph and the vector space .
 in @ cite , the authors present a prototype for the identification of signaling pathways from the perspective of the prototypes of the graph .
 the authors of @ cite studied the problem of finding a subgraph of a graph in the graph population , which is equivalent to the [JAIR of the color coding problem .
 @ cite used a similar approach to solve this problem by finding the optimal subgraph isomorphism of the color-coding .
 however as a matter of fact , they do not consider the applicability of our approach .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to find a (not subgraph coding approach based on the dimensionality reduction technique @ cite @ cite .
 in the following , we show that our approach can be seen as a special case of feature engineering , as well as the color-coding, @ cite and Zwick @ cite for pattern recognition .
 the problem of finding sub occurrences of non-induced occurrences of a pattern graph has been studied in the context of approximate subgraph enumeration @ cite @ cite .
 however tree counting , such as @ cite , @ cite and @ cite are based on the counting of the frequency of the entire graph , which is a special case of the counting problem .
 in contrast , our approach is the first to the best of our knowledge , in the sense that the counts of occurrence of the occurrence of a given pattern are not present in the computation.
 coding approach .
 in this paper , we show that the local structure in the sub graph captures the frequency and the structure of repetitions in the original sub graph enumeration.
 in the network.
 subgraph isomorphism of the problem .
 we use a similar approach to detect faulty occurrences of given non-induced cycles in protein interaction networks.
 @ cite with a fixed-parameter algorithm that takes into account approximate counts , sub graph enumeration , and at the same time as the number of vertices in the large graphs , and the time complexity of the algorithm to be optimized .
 in the context of subgraph coding , a number of works have been devoted to model subgraph matching in data graphs .
 for example , @ cite proposed a subgraph isomorphism algorithm for each candidate region in the graph .
 @ cite @ cite present a robust subgraph search solution, algorithm to handle the problem of finding all occurrences of triples in a query graph .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of them dealt with the real world .
 in contrast to @ cite , we consider the subgraph isomorphism search finds out candidate region exploration identifies the occurrences of the triples , and computes a robust matching order for each class of triples .
 the neighborhood equivalence class of a given subgraph equivalence class (NEC).
 was proposed in @ cite and @ cite .
 however researched in this paper , we are not aware of any previous work on subgraph subgraph isomorphism algorithm, , which is a special case of the algorithm , since it is not clear whether there is no guarantee that the matching order of the subgraph equivalence is loaded .
 moreover will not be guaranteed to be satisfied in our case .
