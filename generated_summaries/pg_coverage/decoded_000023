a number of studies have been proposed to fulfill the problem of recognizing human group activities in surveillance systems @ cite @ cite .
 in the context of human group activity , @ cite proposed a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning approach for learning a dialogue agent from a probabilistic dialogue policy .
 @ cite propose a novel model based on the dominant characteristics of the top-level of a multi-target video , and @ cite used a codebook model to predict the discriminative dialogue of actions .
 however by @ cite , the subtask in our approach is different from theirs in the sense that the relations between persons.
 and the granularities are not available in the graph , rather than the learned relations .
 our approach differs from the previous work in the area of group activities.
 @ cite where the goal is to learn the dynamics of dialogue manager for each video .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to learn a relation between group actions and high-level relations between group activities.
 and spatio-temporal activities .
 our work is inspired by the work of @ cite who used a similar approach to the task of video parsing .
 the problem of group activity recognition in videos has picked considerable interest in the area of activity recognition @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , a hierarchical dynamical system was proposed to identify temporal patterns among human objects .
 @ cite proposed a structural model for real-time action recognition , where a group of subregions.
 action is modeled as a sequence of actions .
 a similar approach was proposed by @ cite and @ cite for action recognition .
 in the context of action space , @ cite proposes a fuzzy subspace based on identified group activities as well as the influence of the shape information of human objects , while @ cite uses a greedy search level to identify the activities in the testing process .
 in contrast to our work , our work is based on the high-level relations of the low-level features , rather than using deep learning for group activity recognition.
 , which is related to our problem , in the sense that the activities of the group are not present in the graph , while our approach does not consider the action space of the underlying action space .
 in this paper , we focus on the relation between group activities and the relations between actions .
