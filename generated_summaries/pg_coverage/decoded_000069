@ cite @ cite use a deep neural network for image synthesis .
 @ cite proposed a domain adaptation method to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a set of image primitives .
 the authors of @ cite present a steganalysis of the embedded secret image and the style of an arbitrary embedded-based image of the cover .
 however to the best of our knowledge , there are two major differences between steganography and cohen : 1 ) we are interested in the following discussions : ( i ) , we want to study how to discover the perceptual quality of the semantic content of the image , and the security of the present work in the context of steganography .
 in contrast to our work , we use a pair of deep neural networks to generate an attack model , which can be used to generate a high resolution of the secret image .
 in addition , we show that recovery constraint can be achieved by aligning the content of all color channels at a given calibrated image .
 however image, , we do not use any training signal to train a full-size secret invariant to the same size .
