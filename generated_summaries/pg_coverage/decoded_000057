recently , [UNK] stabilization methods have been proposed in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 @ cite proposed a method for estimating the stabilization of smooth sparse motion field from the viewpoint of scene changes in camera pose estimation .
 the authors of @ cite present a stabilization method based on the dynamics of the motion vectors of the tracked mesh to their mesh .
 the proposed method is able to stabilize the motion of the scene and the stabilization process .
 in @ cite , the median reprojection of the trajectory points was used to detect the stabilization .
 however even the drift of camera motion is not available in the stabilization , it is not clear how to optimize the camera pose for each unsteady stabilization .
 in contrast , our online video stabilization method can be used to estimate the parameters of the network , which is then enacted by a camera pose .
 we believe that our approach can be easily extended to a wide range of applications , such as slam @ cite and off-line Some @ cite from a manner, camera model .
 however is different from the above mentioned methods , which are not applicable to our problem .
 recently , a number of studies have been proposed to address the problem of video stabilization .
 for example , @ cite proposed a translational motion compensation method based on the use of the particle detector for motion inpainting .
 the translational motion model was proposed in @ cite and @ cite , where the authors proposed a method for estimating the spatial consistency of the completion of the projected motion between the scale-invariant feature transform points and the motion compensation process .
 @ cite extended the idea of @ cite to handle non-rigid and dynamic stabilization of non-rigid motion in videos .
 however , these approaches are not capable of handling camera motion in the stabilization .
 in contrast , our goal is to recover the stabilization of the video stabilization problem , which can be used to estimate the parameters of the pair of image parts .
 in our work , we use the stabilized camera model @ cite for video stabilization , affine transformation , and motion estimation .
 we believe that the translational model is able to capture the long-range geometry of the unsteady network , which is not applicable to the stabilization problem .
 however with the exception of the present paper , it is not clear how to use camera projection to resolve ambiguities caused by motion blur .
 recently , a number of studies have been proposed to address the problem of camera motions in the context of robust camera paths .
 for example , @ cite proposed a task-oriented video stabilization method based on monocular motion and reconstruct the motion between neighboring frames .
 @ cite used a neural network to capture the long-range motion of the unsteady video frames .
 in @ cite @ cite , the camera motion is used to estimate the smoothness of the camera pose and the stabilization of the flow field .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the optical flow , which is the main focus of this work .
 in our work , we utilize the shaky kernel @ cite for online video stabilization in a multi-scale manner .
 however , we show that the stabilized We can be viewed as a special case of the stabilization process .
 in particular , we propose a novel motion model for each unsteady flow method , which can be used to generate a stabilized video slam system .
 the proposed method is able to provide brittle camera paths to high frequency and depth variations in missing regions of videos .
 the video stabilization problem has been widely studied in the context of action recognition @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , the authors proposed the use of a deep neural network for action stabilization .
 @ cite proposed a data-driven approach to deblurring motion blur kernels using group sparse coding, and updates atoms in the dictionary of optical flow .
 the authors of @ cite used a similar approach to video stabilization .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of these works have focused on the stabilization of the stabilization process , which can be categorized into two main approaches .
 first , we focus on the problem of online video stabilization and optical flow based methods .
 in contrast to our work , we assume that the motion trajectories of the unsteady summary can be recovered from a set of input frames , which are not available in the stabilization .
 in this paper , we show that the curve stabilization problem can be integrated into high resolution and visually exceed the quality of the camera .
 our approach is similar to @ cite and @ cite for a more detailed discussion on stabilization .
