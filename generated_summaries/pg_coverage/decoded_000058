there are extensive studies on the problem of optimizing the sensing performance of wireless sensor networks .
 for instance , @ cite proposed a method based on a non-asymptotic analysis of the fusion sides between sensor network and the environment .
 @ cite investigated the tradeoffs of the detection performance of simultaneous localization and mapping for production volume , and @ cite used a non-asymptotic approach to address the number of sensors in the vehicle fusion process .
 in @ cite , a resilient sensor network is placed on the sensing and redundancy of the environment , which is then used to identify the contexts of autonomous vehicles .
 the authors of @ cite present a comprehensive survey on the topic of sensor localization .
 in particular , the authors present a method for the activity detection problem by using a combination of aerial and aerial sensors to detect vehicle 's location in the sensor .
 the work of chen and sun @ cite presented a method to address this problem by providing a thorough review of the state-of-the-art in the area of aerial vehicle localization .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has focused on the design of resilient sensor data .
 in the context of simultaneous localization , the hierarchical generalized Voronoi ( [UNK] ) @ cite was proposed to address the problem of mapping a wide range of different tasks , including landmark density estimation , motion planning , and resilient to environmental attributes such as motion planning and resilient environmental attributes .
 @ cite proposed a method for resilient sensor network based on the performance, of the environment .
 the authors of @ cite show that the design of a resilient sensor is capable of dealing with a large amount of sensor data .
 in contrast to our work , the authors do not consider the performance, cost, and the performance of the trade-offs between the sensor and the sensor 's sensor and actuator to the vehicle 's performance .
 in this paper , we assume that the structure of their operating system is not always available .
 in our approach , the goal is to maximize the performance characteristics of the network , which is governed by the resiliency of the sensor .
 this approach has been shown to be useful in a variety of applications , such as planning @ cite @ cite , and waveform-agile @ cite .
 @ cite @ cite present a method for solving the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for localization and context privacy.
 .
 the authors of @ cite consider the problem of privacy protection in wireless sensor networks .
 @ cite proposed a method to infer the location of events in the environment .
 however such a problem is not limited to the environmental attributes of the environment , which limits the transportation performance of the system .
 in contrast to our approach , the design of sensor data is not considered in the context of both environmental and resiliency between an autonomous vehicle and aerial suite production scheme .
 in our work , we assume that the structure of the sensor nodes is placed at the same time as the number of sensor nodes , which is not available in the sensed data , whereas our approach is able to track the locations of events .
 in this paper , we propose a novel method for resilient sensor network mapping (SLAM) lines , which does not consider the performance, and resiliency of the method , but it is not clear how to use resilient sensor controllers for autonomous vehicles and sensor data .
 a number of studies have been conducted to address the problem of finding a minimum number of sensors in wireless sensor networks .
 for example , @ cite proposed a method for selecting a physical phenomenon from the set of target points in a parallel access channel .
 the authors of @ cite presented a solution for simultaneous localization and mapping of mobile robots to detect the map of the environment .
 @ cite studied the degradation of the coverage and orientation of the sensor in the context of sensor coverage .
 in @ cite , a resilient sensor network is placed over the target points to be completed by the sensors .
 in this work , the authors studied the accuracy of directional sensors and the reliability of the senor of the target data .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has focused on the coverage of directional senses in the sensor space .
 in contrast , we aim to predict the state of the large amount of data needed for the trade-off between the number and resiliency of distinct sensors , and the performance of the suite of sensor data is available .
