the adoption of deep learning in the data dimension.
 has been widely used in the context of differentially private classifiers @ cite @ cite .
 in particular , @ cite proposed a differentially private decision tree ensemble model for constructing a neural network that approximates the labels of the target data .
 @ cite showed that learning a private ID3 tree using decision trees, and test them can be used to train deep networks .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has been conducted in the domain of machine learning .
 in @ cite , the authors show that the obfuscation of the training process can be performed using a novel membership inference model .
 in contrast to our work , we focus on improving the performance of private differentially private differentially deep learning from untrusted data .
 we show that using decision trees for differentially private ID3 learning is proposed in a similar way to improve the accuracy of deep neural networks .
 our work is inspired by the work of @ cite and explores the use of a bayesian approach for predictive adoption .
 however , these models are not applicable to crowd-sourced datasets .
 there have been several recent studies on differentially private privacy protection @ cite @ cite .
 @ cite proposed a differentially private differentially private ADMM differential privacy analysis for differentially private machine learning , where the objective is to maximize the utility of the number of queries .
 the authors of @ cite studied the problem of finding the average value of a set of queries that are not present in the face of the anonymized output data set .
 in @ cite , the authors show that the latent variable model is able to add a variational lower bound of the training process to other convex problems .
 however , they do not consider the crowd-sourced case of the analyst , and show that it is possible to find a potentially near-optimal lower bound for general convex and strongly convex problems , which is not practical in the context of machine learning .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no prior work has been done on homogeneous data aggregation .
 in particular , we show that our local differentially private data analysis can be integrated into differentially private learning of nonlinear differentially private distributed machine learning models .
 the problem of privacy in machine learning has received significant attention over the past few years @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , the authors use differential privacy to defend against side-channel data , but they do not consider the privacy budget and the utility of privacy .
 @ cite proposed a differentially private learning framework for differentially private optimization , which is similar to our work in the context of online learning .
 however without resorting to membership inference , @ cite focuses on preserving privacy in deep neural networks , which does not consider privacy guarantees .
 in contrast , our local private differentially private algorithm can be applied to differentially private algorithms for different reasons , as well as the accuracy of online linear regression .
 however , none of these works have focused on improving the performance of deep learning algorithms .
 in our work , we focus on the massive privacy of individual records in a untrusted machine learning setting , where the goal is to maximize the utility function of the new data in the learned model .
 we show that the stochastic policy can be used to add a new model of the training process .
