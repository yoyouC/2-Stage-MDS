the most related work to ours is the work of @ cite , where the authors use it to generate a model for attribute manipulation in target domain .
 @ cite proposed a Learning method that learns a mapping between the source and target domains into the source domain and the target source domain to the target domain , and the learned projection is used to generate the latent representations of the source image .
 in contrast to our work , the authors proposed a novel method to jointly learn a projection matrix and the information of the reference face image .
 the authors in @ cite use a similar approach to @ cite for the task of zero-shot classification .
 however to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that considers the interpretability of the latent space and latent space , which can be used to learn the latent representation of an autoencoder .
 however in the context of zero-shot learning , we believe that the state of the art approaches can be modeled as a special case of the domain of the autoencoder .
 in this paper , we use mmd as a metric for zero-shot classification @ cite @ cite .
 generative adversarial networks ( gans ) have been widely used for image recognition @ cite @ cite , image image reconstruction @ cite and image generation @ cite .
 recently , @ cite proposed a generative adversarial network ( gan ) to learn the generation of images from a specific domain .
 @ cite used a conditional gan to learn a composition of label and latent attributes of the latent space and the latent vectors of the generated face images .
 the work of @ cite investigates the interpretability of the generative model for the task of semi-supervised learning .
 however - in the domain of image manipulation tasks , the state of the art generative models have been used to solve the problem of detecting and diverse anomaly in a variety of images .
 however , these approaches are not capable of modeling the information of the autoencoder , rather than being able to learn disentangled representations of attributes such as faces or objects .
 our approach belongs to the latter category tailored to our work , as we aim to directly learn the latent representations of the input image to a lower dimension of generated image images .

 matrix decomposition @ cite and semi-supervised matrix factorization @ cite have also been used for image inpainting .
 @ cite proposed a semi-supervised learning based method to predict the interpretability of the latent space .
 however to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work in the domain of an image inpainting task .
 in @ cite , the authors present a novel method for semantic image inpainting by conditioning a perceptual loss between the input image and the recovered representations of the corrupted image in the latent image .

 in contrast to our work , we propose to use deep neural networks to learn the latent representations for a given image .
 we learn a latent representation for the latent representation of the autoencoder , which can be used to predict semantic information in a single image .

 several recent works have investigated the interpretability of the latent space of an auto-encoder for a given image @ cite @ cite .
 however to the best of our knowledge , this approach has been successfully applied to the domain of image attribute classification @ cite and reconstruction @ cite , as well as the derivation of the learned representations of different attributes such as variational autoencoders @ cite or generative adversarial networks ( gans ) @ cite have been used to generate realistic samples .
 however , these methods are not applicable to the problem of latent space , since they assume that the latent variables are disentangled during the training data .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to learn a latent representation of an autoencoder , which acts as a regularizer and encourages the expressiveness to be unstable .
 however because of the inherently ambiguous role , we do not require a large amount of training data , which is not available in the real world .
 in addition , our approach is able to learn disentangled latent representations , which can be viewed as a special case of our model .
 however in this paper , we focus on generating the latent representation in a latent space .
