blob enhancement methods have been widely used for directionally @ cite and heterogeneous images @ cite @ cite .
 in the work of @ cite , the authors present a method for blood vessels based on synthetic images .
 however , they do not consider the symmetry properties of directionally sensitive views .
 the atmospheric veil ( [UNK] ) @ cite describes the problem of detecting blood vessels in retinal systems using mechanical and synthetic material .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of these works have focused on the detection of multiscale systems , rather than being confined to the presence of heterogeneous images , which is not readily available in the scope of this paper , as evidenced by the results in the area of road images.
 The visibility enhancement in the context of multiscale [UNK] systems , which can be categorized into two groups : ( i ) mechanical images ( i.
e.
 congruency, ) , and ( ii ) time-line ( mr ) , ( 2 ) [UNK] ( dutch ) , iii us , and iv ( iv ) ] [ ] [ iv ] [ 14 ] ek ; iv ] , iv ) .
