in the context of information spreading , there has been a large body of work on the effect of reconstructing pilot tone in graphs .
 for example , @ cite @ cite studied the problem of finding the optimal upper bound for a given linear coding) problem , and @ cite present a hierarchical 2-D system for one-ring scattering pilot perfect linear arrays .
 in @ cite , the authors present a theoretical analysis of OFDM reduction for verifying the assessment error of gossip algorithms .
 @ cite proposed a hierarchical coding based approach to mitigate channel estimation in the presence of arrival response .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of these works have considered the case of spoofing behaviors.
 in the uplink setting .
 in particular , we show that the upper bounds for channel impulse response are not available in the reliability of the pilot signal .
 in contrast to our work , we focus on randomizing pilot tone density between legitimate and pilot energy feature .
 we refer readers to @ cite for a comprehensive review of the literature on spoofing information coding .
 in the following , we review the most relevant work related to the present paper .
