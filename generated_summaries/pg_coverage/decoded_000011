recently Temporal @ cite proposed a method for weakly-supervised temporal annotation in long short-term memory ( lstm ) @ cite @ cite , @ cite and @ cite .
 recently , a number of extensions have been proposed to address the problem of action localization in untrimmed videos .
 @ cite propose a weakly supervised temporal action localization model for Temporal action localization and detection network, and (3) @ cite uses movie scripts for action recognition and detection of human actions .
 in @ cite the authors propose a novel loss function to learn the learned action models from untrimmed long videos as initialization for a long short-term of action models and the requirement of manual annotation for action localization .
 the authors of @ cite present a clustering algorithm to identify adjacent segments in the feature space .
 however called @ cite in this paper , we focus on the frame-level score of the action feature features, , which is more challenging in the form of counting loss and a counting criterion .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to learn discriminative action features for multi-label center loss , and we use a more efficient approach to improve the performance of action recognition .
