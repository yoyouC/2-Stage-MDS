there is a large body of work on verifiable methods , such as tallying @ cite , encrypted @ cite and others @ cite @ cite .
 in the context of tallying , the voting system has been used for tallying of encrypted networks @ cite ; see @ cite for the surveys of tallying fractional votes.
 schemes .
 @ cite present a slate Our algorithm for tallying up encrypted Our sequentially, agents in a single candidate.
 manner .
 these counters are then designed for the election of encrypted encrypted candidates , which are similar to our work .
 however , they do not consider the problem of threats to the candidates , and do not require any sort of cheap resistance of the voting trackers .
 in contrast to our announced result.
 , our work is also related to the present work in this paper , and we compare the results of our previous work in the following section we give a comprehensive survey on the exclusion of STV style systems , as well as the [UNK] construction of the election complexity of the outcomes of approval votes in refinement .
 we refer readers to @ cite to survey papers that are closely related to ours .
 there is a large literature on electronic voting systems @ cite @ cite , which has already been considered as a special case of ThreeBallot @ cite and [UNK] @ cite .
 however to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work on resistance threats in cryptographic voting systems .
 for example , @ cite present a universal composability framework for tallying end-to-end end-to-end schemes .
 @ cite use a [UNK] algorithm for tallying up she by writing , and @ cite show that counters are dependent on voting trackers , while none of them considers the modification of the voter 's voting system .
 in contrast to our work , we focus on threats to the voting system , rather than resistance confidence intervals .
 our work differs from the scope of this paper since we aim to detect voting trackers that are based on resistance and universal verifiability .
 we refer readers to @ cite for an extensive discussion on the topic of academic election and thread integrity detection in the context of academic academic applications .
 in particular , we review the most relevant work related to the present work in this area .
