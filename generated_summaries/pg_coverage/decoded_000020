one of the most popular trends of fake news detection is the youtube @ cite @ cite , who began to focus on fake news reading on social media .
 @ cite proposed a review of detecting fake news in social media , and @ cite studied the detection of fake imagery in fake news .
 in @ cite the authors present a comprehensive review on fake tweet patterns .
 they studied the problem of fake reviewers in the frequency of computer vision .
 the authors of @ cite used a multi-branch model to extract visual features from different fake news detector , and used a regression model to predict the complex patterns of fake-news images .
 the work @ cite showed that real images can be transferred to unseen fake news , misinformation , and semantic levels, .
 in contrast to our work , we focus on detecting and capture fake news from fake images .
 our work differs from these works in that it focuses on fake imagery , rather than relying on hand-engineered features , while our work is more broadly applicable to the task of predicting visual features .
 the most related work in this area is the work by @ cite .
 in the context of fake news detection , @ cite proposed a method to detect fake face images by using the extracted features extracted from the real world .
 the authors of @ cite used a deep neural network model to predict the complex patterns of fake-news images in the frequency domain .
 in @ cite , the authors showed that the proposed method can be used to detect visual features from different semantic levels of the context .
 @ cite studied the problem of detecting fake news in social media .
 in this work , we focus on understanding the characteristics of fake images , rather than relying on the frequency of the fake images .
 our work differs from the scope of this paper to the fake review detection of fake faces as well as human news detection and political detection .
 we refer readers to @ cite for a comprehensive review of existing literature on fake face detection .
 in particular , we review the most relevant work related to fake face image review detection .
 the most related work to ours is the work of zhou al @ cite and [UNK] @ cite .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of them dealt with the specific task of fake face review sequences .
 the spread of fake news detection has received considerable attention in the past few years .
 for example , @ cite proposed a tri-relationship embedding model for news dissemination in social media verification process .
 @ cite studied the problem of multimodal fake news verification and found that users can be used to detect rumors in fake news .
 in @ cite , the authors present a tri-relationship Neural embedding for news verification , while @ cite @ cite used social context features for detecting fake news spreading .
 in contrast , our work focuses on predicting the characteristics of fake images , which can be categorized into two classes : ( 1 ) the visual content of the images ( i.
e.
 collected ) , and ( 3 ) the story content ( i.
e.
 conducted in the frequency space ) and the frequency ( i.
e.
 also referred to the scope of this paper ) .
 in the following , we review previous work on fake news , as well as the key difference between our work and the differences between social media and fake-news images .
 we refer readers to @ cite for a more comprehensive review of the most important topics that are relevant to our work .
 recently supervisory attention has been successfully applied to fake news detection @ cite @ cite .
 [UNK] @ cite proposed a method to extract visual features from different semantic levels in the frequency domain .
 @ cite used a deep cnn for semantic segmentation , where the adversarial loss is used to generate the input image .
 however , the proposed method is able to capture the inherent appearance of the input images , which is not plausible in the context of fake news .
 in contrast to our work , we propose a novel framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation using the visual content of fake images as real images .
 our work differs from the previous works in this domain , while we aim to learn the visual features of the image and the real image image .
 in addition , we show that the proposed discriminator can be viewed as a way to learn a discriminative model for fake news images in the wild ( see @ cite for a more comprehensive review ) .
 in the following , we will focus on the problem of generating fake images in fake news posts,include images .
 in this paper , we focus on semi-supervised learning based on the frequency of the ground truth .
