a number of works have been devoted to resolving the impact of facial landmarks in face detection.
 @ cite @ cite .
 for instance , @ cite proposed a context-constrained hallucination approach for super-resolution.
 building deformable face segment scans .
 the authors of @ cite present a method to detect 17 facial landmarks and the desired landmark.
 High in the training set .
 @ cite propose a bootstrap process based on the sparsity of the information of the face in the high-to-low image .
 however proposed a method for estimating the fidelity of high-resolution image and the orientation of the input image .
 in @ cite , the authors proposed to use a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) to solve the problem for position-sensitive semantic segmentation, .
 however the results in this work are not suitable for human pose estimation and point detection .
 in contrast to our approach , our proposed method is able to detect the high-resolution representation of a low-resolution representation of low-resolution input images , which is also related to our work .
 in our work , we focus on the [UNK] of position-sensitive energy function in streams , and we are able to learn a representation of high-to-low low-resolution image .
 the encoder-decoder architecture has been widely used in computer vision for image restoration @ cite @ cite and resource-aware image-to-image translation @ cite .
 however state-of-the art results in a variety of computer vision tasks , such as image classification @ cite , semantic segmentation @ cite In @ cite or research.
 @ cite have been proposed to improve the composition of high-resolution images .
 for example , @ cite proposed a unified framework for combining cnn with deep neural networks .
 @ cite use a recurrent neural network ( rnn ) to encode the input image into a single image .
 however , these methods are not applicable to our problem , since we are able to learn the high-resolution representation of the input images .
 in contrast to our work , we employ a novel module based on the idea of inter-frame and spatial-wise redundancy in the high-to-low image to facilitate the interpolation of the representation .
 however by contrast , our proposed approach can be viewed as a special case of the encoder-decoder framework , which is the focus of our work .
 in particular , we show that the pre-processing step is able to expand the segmentation of the upsampling process .
 the object detection problem has been extensively studied in the context of image super-resolution @ cite @ cite .
 in particular , sparse-coding based methods have been proposed in @ cite , where the authors use sparse signal recovery to improve the accuracy of the face detector .
 @ cite proposed a method for estimating the similarity between the interpolated patches and the high-to-low image patch .
 the authors of @ cite used a sparse representation of the low-resolution and high-resolution image patches to reconstruct the hr image .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has been conducted in the domain of position-sensitive semantic segmentation .
 in contrast , our work aims to learn a non-linear mapping between the image and the hr representation , and the goal is to minimize the reconstruction error between the output of the hr and the target image .
 in the following , we have shown that the sparse representation can be reconstructed from a single image , which can be used to estimate the distance between the lr and hr images .
 we show that the sparse-coding algorithm can be very unstable when there is a large gap between the accuracy and rmse .
 there has been a large body of work on the problem of generating varying motion blur in the input image .
 for example , @ cite proposed a method for estimating the blur kernels in the high-resolution camera .
 @ cite uses a hybrid approach to jointly estimate blur kernels and varying blur kernels .
 in @ cite @ cite , the authors propose to reduce the resolution of blur in stereo images .
 however to the best of our knowledge , this approach has not yet been considered in the literature .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to learn a (SR) representation of stereo images from training images for position-sensitive pose blur in video and fog depth estimation .
 however by contrast , our proposed blur streams can be viewed as a special case of motion blur .
 we also employ the parallax While method @ cite to solve the motion blur problem in the high-to-low camera .
 however as a consequence of the aforementioned methods , the downsampled frames are not fully connected to a single frame , which is not suitable for object detection .
 in addition , our approach integrates the advantages of both the and high-to-low image streams .
 there has been a large body of work on natural image super-resolution @ cite @ cite , image instance segmentation @ cite and image captioning @ cite .
 in particular , one of the most popular approaches to solve this problem is to use deep convolutional neural networks ( cnns ) for single image patches .
 for example , @ cite proposed a fully convolutional neural network for image classification .
 @ cite used a cnn to regress a volumetric representation of low resolution depth images .
 however to the best of our knowledge , this approach has not yet been seen in the literature .
 in contrast to the above mentioned methods , the tone of the input image of the objects is not available .
 in this paper , we propose a method to predict the hr representation of the low resolution image size .
 we use a voxel grid as input to obtain diverse results for position-sensitive paths voxels in the high-to-low images .
 we believe that this approach can be used to reconstruct the object 's pose and orientation of the object in the image primitives .
 in our work , we provide a unified restoration model for the visually impaired .
 there have been a large amount of work on the resolution of the acquisition of range images in the high-to-low image domain .
 for example , @ cite proposed a method for the testing of range images.
 and object pose estimation .
 @ cite present a post-processing method based on the [UNK] of @ cite and @ cite .
 however by contrast , our proposed approach is orthogonal to the work of zhang al @ cite , which uses a monocular camera to synthesize low-resolution range images , and then recover the entire representation of the input image .
 in contrast to our work , our method does not require a large number of registered images , which is not available in the pipeline of human pose estimation and depth estimation .
 we believe that our method is able to enhance the range of position-sensitive vision in resolutions.
 representations .
 however including the high-to-low camera images are not available for the downscaling phase , and the latter is not directly applicable to position-sensitive operators .
 in this paper , we focus on the problem of range sensors for registered low-resolution representations , which can be solved by a single camera .
