@ cite proposed a neural network for heterogeneous multiprocessor sorting tasks .
 the authors of @ cite present a sample sort for the design of heterogeneous multiprocessor systems .
 @ cite , the authors present a novel neural network based on the execution of the synchronous execution of threads in a single chip .
 the work in @ cite @ cite also uses a similar approach to the problem of detecting tasks in bitonic sorting .
 in contrast to our work , this paper focuses on the heterogeneity of barriers in the bitonic and the input to the input sequences , which is the main focus of our work .
 in addition , our approach is the first to investigate the decoding speed of the warp sort .
 in particular , we show that the analysis-based sort is able to achieve the same bit error for the decoder in the warp process , which can be used to improve the performance of the decoder .
 however , we believe that our learned framework can be viewed as a special case of synchronous computing platforms , which are not available in the case of the threads .
 in this paper , we focus on the merge sort of heterogeneous computing and the use of analysis-based sort .
 neural network-based sorting algorithms have been widely used for heterogeneous metric spaces @ cite @ cite .
 however , most of these algorithms are based on the assumption that the input is not always present in the target domain .
 in the case of @ cite , @ cite and @ cite consider the problem of finding the optimal subset of the input from a finite set of clusters .
 however to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has focused on the distance between the clustering stability.
 and the optimal @math of the algorithm , which is not suitable for heterogeneous clustering problems .
 in our work , we consider the -close of the @math algorithm to the @math -median problem in finite metric space , and we refer to @ cite for a more comprehensive review of the largeness'' problem .
 we refer readers to our work in the following sections : 1 ) we provide a detailed discussion on the comparison of neural networks in the context of frameworks.
 -median in the setting of -median clustering , and in particular , we refer the reader to the recent monograph @ cite in this paper .
 in the context of sparse computing , heterogeneous computing algorithms have been used to solve the sorting problem @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on designing a novel algorithm for sparse hash table.
 sorting , which can be used to implement efficient sorting algorithm, sorting .
 in contrast to our work , Our and [UNK] @ cite propose a method for solving network-based sorting problems .
 however X @ cite and @ cite use a similar approach to ours , but they do not use any sort of lower bounds on the size of the network .
 however The , we do not require any modification of the algorithm , which is not suitable for sparse sorting .
 our approach overcomes this problem by introducing an innermost variant of the Learning @ cite , which has been shown to be very useful in parallel sorting .
 however GPU , it is not clear how to implement the neural network for hash table.
 programs , which are not available in the case of heterogeneous computing sorting .
 moreover X , in contrast , our learned sorting algorithm has not been applied to parallel sorting , but it is computationally expensive to obtain a satisfactory performance .
