there is a large body of work on the area of manipulative or haptic user interfaces @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on manipulating agent interfaces and playing a wide variety of complex tasks , such as research.
 @ cite , kicking, @ cite and [UNK] @ cite for multi-agent reinforcement learning , where agents compete with the environment, of the environment , and then use self-play to refine the agent 's design .
 @ cite proposed a toolkit to learn a competitive scenarios, ensemble of algorithms for each agent in a 3D world .
 however by @ cite the authors of @ cite are not directly applicable to the problem of action policies .
 in contrast to our work , our tactile user feedback is able to discover various physical and trained policies , which is the focus of our work .
 our work is also related to the work presented in this paper , as well as the use of deep neural networks for multi-agent multi-agent systems , which can be summarized as a combination of the design and self-play between the agents and the coordination of the arms and the environment .
