previous work has focused on detecting personal insults and ship systems @ cite @ cite .
 in particular , [UNK] @ cite provides a tool to detect changes in social streams .
 @ cite proposed a set of event detection algorithms that can be used for ship ship ship capsizing.
 .
 the authors of @ cite present a distributed event detection approach based on the Twitter dirty log data @ cite , which is the focus of our work .
 in contrast to our work , the work in @ cite focuses on the extraction of emergency response events in the stream , and @ cite uses a group of al @ cite to detect the emergence of emergency emergency detection incidents in terrorist telecommunication systems .
 our work differs in the area of research in the field of dynamic network analysis , where the goal is to find a characterization of the response can be inferred from a given query , rather than being able to predict the response lifetime of the world .
 in this paper , we focus on the problem of detecting malicious events in a ship , focusing on discussing how a policy is managed .
