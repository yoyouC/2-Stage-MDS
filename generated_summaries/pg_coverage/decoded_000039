body part parsing has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision and computer vision .
 most of the recent works have focussed on the task of segmenting body-part detection and pose estimation .
 for example , @ cite proposed a deep neural network for predicting the anatomical similarity of a body part of part of the body joints .
 @ cite use a deformable part-based model ( dpm ) @ cite to predict semantic body parts of people in the context of part segmentation, .
 the work in @ cite @ cite considers the relationship between annotation quality and geometric and appearance constraints , which is similar to our work .
 however such methods are not applicable to semantic segmentation and pose priors .
 in our work , we aim to learn a parsing network from a large number of annotated part configurations , which can be used to guide the detection of weak labels for each body part.
 .
 in contrast to our approach , we use an iterative refinement to learn the mask and geometry mask of human part actions .
 our work is also related to the work of @ cite and @ cite , where the goal is to segment the number of hypotheses generated by a skeleton .
 human pose estimation is a challenging problem in computer vision and machine learning @ cite @ cite .
 in the context of human parsing , @ cite proposed a self-supervised semantic part segmentation approach for benchmarking action recognition .
 @ cite propose a semantic part parsing based learning framework for parsing multiple people in a single body part of a body part mask based on the high-level knowledge of the face or inferring instance belongings .
 the work of @ cite extends the work by @ cite and @ cite , where the candidate bounding box annotations are used to train a parsing model .
 however to the best of our knowledge , none of these approaches have been proposed to address the problem of gender and action and action recognition , respectively , as well as the availability of annotated part annotations for each body mention .
 in contrast to our work , we aim to learn new supervision for a large number of weak labels for a given body of annotated body part parsing , which is not available in the instance-level human parsing dataset .
 the proposed method is able to learn the semantic segmentation mask from the body of objects .
