there has been a significant amount of work on ridge sampling and image deblocking @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of sensitive analyzing blood vessels in the presence of a large number of clean color images .
 in @ cite , the authors show that the proposed ridge blob measure can be used to reconstruct the color images in the synthetic images .
 the authors of @ cite use a pointwise adaptive manner.
 thresholded or attenuated SA-DCT coefficients to compute a local estimate of the image and the adaptive-shape support.
 .
 @ cite proposed an algorithm to detect both vessels and characterize blood vessels and both color properties of the signal and the definition of the atmospheric veil subject to the possibility of having ringing artifacts .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the sensitive transform coefficients are used to estimate the color number of coefficients .
 the results obtained in this paper can be viewed as a special case where the atmospheric light is assumed to lie in a two-dimensional space , which is not the case of the oriented measure of the multiscale systems .
