video stabilization has also been investigated in the context of video stabilization @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on a fisheye and omnidirectional gold standard in-camera and in-camera and omnidirectional video dataset .
 @ cite , @ cite and @ cite provide a calibration strategy for the stabilization of two-view triangulation .
 in contrast to our work , our method is based on the assumption that the room and new frames can be estimated from a pair of points of the scene .
 our approach is similar to the work of zhou al @ cite who proposed an approach to reconstruct the room of a 3D stabilization in the presence of both appearance and inertial cues .
 our work is also closely related to our approach , but in our work we focus only on lower bounds on the cost based on contextual constraints .
 the difference between our work and the previous work @ cite is that we are able to estimate the cost of the classic global calibration of errors and viewpoint variation in scene understanding, and view-based stabilization .
 we also use a similar approach to video depth estimation and approximate super-resolution .
