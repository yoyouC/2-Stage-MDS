there has been a growing body of work on differentially private machine learning @ cite @ cite , @ cite and @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the privacy-preserving privacy of the loss of privacy for privacy and trust protection attacks .
 our work is also related to the differentially private ADMM ( smc ) method @ cite to address the problem of finding the rotation and differentiability of data distributions in order to minimize the convergence rate for the loss function .
 in @ cite the authors propose a multi-column privacy model that reconstructs the data from the original data from a distribution based on the alternating direction method of the learning algorithm .
 @ cite proposed a differentially private privacy model for distributed distributed machine learning using a perturbation approach .
 in contrast , our work focuses on the privacy preserving data mining and privacy protection in differentially private, .
 we also use dual variable perturbation to analyze the sensitive information of the trained model , which is the focus of our work .
 we show that our privacy-preserving DML framework outperforms the work of @ cite which is similar to our approach .
 our work is related to the work of @ cite and @ cite .
 in @ cite , the authors present a privacy-preserving framework for privacy preserving privacy in online learning.
 learning .
 their algorithm is based on the assumption that the users trust between the server and the public coordination can be interpreted as a incentive mechanism .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of preserving the utility of user privacy and privacy protection in distributed machine learning .
 in contrast , we do not consider the heterogeneous privacy of the analysis of sensitive levels and sensitive information.
 data , which is not available in the context of privacy preserving trust protection ( which has been shown to be a good choice in this paper ) .
 in particular , we show that our privacy-preserving framework is able to achieve a good performance on differentially private privacy .
 we also use a cascade of the noise-adding method, @ cite @ cite to optimize the average value for the aggregate allocation of the data in the framework of the generalization of the privacy and maximizing the accuracy of the objective function in the problem .
 in our experiments , we will show that the suboptimality of the loss and the privacy protection will be weaker than the non-interactive model .
 in this work , we focus on the assumption that the users ' trust protection and design can be used to estimate privacy losses .
 in @ cite , a privacy-preserving private framework is used to capture the sensitive information of the trained model .
 @ cite considers the problem of finding a utility function that is inversely proportional to the number of self-information .
 however , this approach does not include any sort of privacy protection .
 in this paper , we show that our privacy-preserving DML estimation procedure can be applied to heterogeneous privacy concerns .
 our work is also related to the work of @ cite and @ cite who propose to use a bayesian approach to estimate the optimal mapping between the server and preserves the most likely privacy properties .
 in contrast to our work , this work focuses on the performance of the marginal information leakage.
 in the presence of a user 's cost function , which can be interpreted as a convex optimization problem .
 in particular , we use noise-adding @ cite to recommend the sensitive levels of the trust , and show that the best achievable rates are known .
 we believe that our approach can be seen as a special case of privacy preserving privacy .
