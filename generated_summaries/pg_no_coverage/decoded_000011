segment-based action localization has a long history in computer vision and has resulted in numerous recent developments in weakly-supervised action recognition @ cite @ cite .
 in this section , we focus on action recognition and temporal action localization .
 action localization is closely related to weakly-supervised learning and action recognition .
 for example , in @ cite , a selective search method has been proposed to learn action models from untrimmed videos .
 @ cite proposed a discriminative clustering approach to localize actions in a long video sequence .
 the authors of @ cite use a attention model to learn the learned features from untrimmed video that are extracted from video-level class labels .
 in contrast to our work , we use enhanced localization to enhance the separability of learned action features, to improve the learned discriminative action feature detectors .
 we also use the separability mechanism to relieve the dependence of action category labels and the counting network to estimate the action samples, .
 we use a similar approach to the form of action classification and detection of action detection .
 our approach is similar to our approach , but the crf-based method @ cite uses a adapted localization approach .
