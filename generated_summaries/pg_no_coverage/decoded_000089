transfer learning has been extensively studied in the past years @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , the sampling strategy is used to estimate the distribution divergence from the source and target data .
 @ cite proposed a novel transfer learning scheduler that learns to minimize the importance of the marginal and conditional distribution of the target domain .
 the attribute imbalance problem is also studied by @ cite and @ cite for imbalanced learning problems .
 the authors of @ cite propose to learn the latent attributes from an ensemble of classifiers to learn a critical review of the class imbalance problem .
 in this work , we focus on the imbalanced learning problem , which is similar to our proposed curriculum learning approach, attribute analysis .
 we compare the results obtained in this paper , and we refer the reader to the survey of park and park and zhao et al al @ cite to assess the effectiveness of knowledge discovery methods .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the data distribution can be inferred from the balanced data set into multiple balanced ones .
 in the following , we show that the sampling algorithm is able to tackle the imbalanced data learning problem .
 multi-task learning has also been applied to online attribute analysis @ cite @ cite , imbalanced data learning @ cite and hierarchical clustering @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the sampling of deep learning and loss learning to balanced classification tasks .
 we use a similar approach to regularize the learning procedure to the data distribution .
 in contrast to our approach , the sampling strategy of @ cite is based on the idea of learning a neural network to supervise the training process .
 in @ cite the authors propose a curriculum learning approach to improve the performance of online AUC maximization .
 @ cite propose an end-to-end deep learning algorithm for online object classification and imbalanced attribute recognition .
 DCL et al by zhang et al al @ cite proposed a method to learn deep learning from the interaction between clothing and clothing dimension.
 .
 they use a multi-task classifier to learn the minority attribute classes , and then train a classifier to predict the facial label of the minority classes.
 This .
 the authors of this paper can be seen as an extension of the present work , which we present in this paper .
