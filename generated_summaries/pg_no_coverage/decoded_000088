there has been a growing body of work in the area of conversational avatar @ cite @ cite .
 in this section , we briefly review related work related to our work , and we refer the interested reader to the survey @ cite for reviews and discuss discussions on the topic of the social networks in the context of social capital ( [UNK] ) @ cite , [UNK] @ cite and [UNK] magazine @ cite that gather information about the conversations between humans and humans .
 the authors of @ cite investigate the structure of social networks , and found that the potential to predict the dialogue linked feelings of the users would be more likely to be matched .
 however , they did not consider the influence of the scale of the conversations .
 in @ cite the problem of designing a sequence of people can be interpreted as belonging to the state of the art self-report dialogue system .
 in the work , @ cite used a neural language model to estimate the dialogues collected from flickr , and showed that the specific activities of the accounts correspond to the political orientation of the spoken dialogue .
