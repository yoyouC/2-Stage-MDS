motion planning and trajectory planning have been proposed in @ cite @ cite .
 @ cite , the authors proposed a planner for dynamic probabilistic environments.
 The ( [UNK] ) , where the learned graph is used to find a collision-free trajectory .
 in this work , we use a stochastic trajectory optimization approach to estimate the position of the graph and the probability of each trajectory .
 the algorithm is based on the assumption that the unreachable part of the environment is given by the angle between the motion and trajectory of the robot .
 this approach has also been used in the context of dynamic obstacle avoidance in robotics @ cite and articulated movements in a simulated environment @ cite or fluid dynamics of maximum entropy @ cite where the goal is to minimize the collisions between the pedestrians of multiple possible paths .
 in contrast , our approach does not assume that the graph is equipped with an infinite number of paths , which can be solved in polynomial time @ math , where @ math and @ math are the trajectories of @ math .
 this is akin to the fact that @ math is the indicator of reoptimization intervals .
 there has been a growing body of work in the area of motion planning and motion planning @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of grasping in dynamic and uncertain environments .
 in @ cite , a goal is to find a collision free path for grasping in a single-source shortest paths .
 the problem is solved by @ cite and @ cite ; @ cite is a physics-based trajectory optimization approach .
 @ cite considers the minimal time on multiple robot motion related to kinematic and dynamic constraints in the connectivity graph .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the trajectories of paths between the robot and movable obstacles can be inferred from different classes of the robot configuration .
 our work is also closely related to the work of [UNK] et al al @ cite which considers the number of trajectories in a local planner .
 however , these works do not take into account the motion planning problem , but do not consider the problem in settings where the underlying graph structure is not available , and the feasibility of the solution is not guaranteed .
 [UNK] et al as @ cite suggested that the remaining graph is able to actively help in the context of uncertain and uncertain environments .
 in this work , we focus on the lives of multiple possible paths , which is the focus of our work .
 we use a similar approach to the problem of finding a potential manipulation in homotopy classes .
 in contrast , our approach looks at a high dimensional state of the art in this paper , however , we do not assume that the graph is equipped with geodesics , and the remaining edges are more likely to occur in the vicinity of the graph .
 our approach is similar to that of @ cite , since the feasibility of the online setting is not guaranteed to be applicable in cluttered environments .
 however collaborators are very different from ours , since we are interested in the presence of a single graph , which can be seen as a special case of interest .
 optimization, et al al @ cite discuss the use of homotopy trajectories to find robots with a given set of paths , and show that this approach can be applied to dynamic environments .
