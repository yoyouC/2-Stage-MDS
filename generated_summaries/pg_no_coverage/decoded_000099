the problem of computing matrix profile and Voronoi computations has been proposed in @ cite @ cite .
 @ cite , the authors proposed a new algorithm based on a dynamic variant of the brushfire algorithm , called novel, , which is based on the K-means algorithm .
 the authors of @ cite use a similar approach to learn an embedding for the task of the multivariate time series .
 in this work , we use the Euclidean algorithm @ cite to generate new time intervals for the distance maps of the max-pooling diagrams .
 this approach is also used in the manifold-based distance metric learning .
 in contrast to our approach , the closest to our work , is the first to the best of our knowledge and the present work in the next section .
 we present a brief overview of the most relevant work in this section , and we refer the reader to the survey @ cite for a more comprehensive overview of learning algorithms for the partitioning of initial matrix profile @ math and @ math , respectively @ math @ cite and the @ math -way distance matrix @ math .
 we refer interested readers to the books and references therein .
 the problem of computing matrix profile has been extensively studied in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 @ cite , @ cite and @ cite are used to estimate the distance between the time and storage of the time series .
 in this work , we use a similar approach to reduce the dimensionality of the matrix @ math , where @ math is the number of columns of @ math and @ math .
 for @ math -means clustering , the authors of @ cite use a rank-one matrix to compute the matrix case , where each row has to be drawn from @ math to the matrices of the largest time matrix .
 this algorithm is based on the assumption that the weights @ math are chosen at least @ math with @ math columns and columns of length @ math ( resp , @ math ) .
 however as a corollary , the convergence of the algorithm is @ math for all @ math waiting time .
 the authors in @ cite show that if @ math time is greater than the singular value @ math in the matrix nuclear norm @ math of the rank-one matrix .
