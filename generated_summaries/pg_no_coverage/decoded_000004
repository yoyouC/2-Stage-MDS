there has been a growing body of work on distributed power system optimization for architectural concepts @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , the authors present a distributed system for citizen and optimization of elastic state scaling .
 the authors of @ cite use features to tackle the problem of simultaneous temperature, and optimal power efficiency .
 @ cite proposed a distributed algorithms to select the optimal frequency from application-level v3 and E5-2600 ChronoStream series based on the assumption that the frequencies of the v3 nominal sleep are equal to the potential energy dissipation for the given stream of idle dimensions .
 in this work , @ cite proposes a reinforcement learning approach to control the power consumption of the power range of a distributed voltage control, transition behavior, .
 in the work of [UNK] et al al @ cite and @ cite the authors propose to use a nonlinear relationships between application-level and dynamic concurrency throttling ( [UNK] ) to reduce the potential effects of energy consumption and energy consumption .
 in spite of the number of changes in the energy consumption , the performance of these systems can be reduced to the characteristics of the clock frequency .
 our work is also related to the work of @ cite and @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the effects of dynamic power management interference and frequency scaling , which is the focus of our work .
 in @ cite , the authors propose a predictive execution capabilities for both dynamic voltage-frequency and dynamic voltage and dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) ( i.
e.
 that different concurrency efficiency can be used in the context of hybrid programming ) .
 @ cite present a novel algorithm to measure the power and energy consumption of the server and anticipate application power and the effect of energy efficiency .
 the authors also use hybrid programming to study the scope of hybrid models .
 in contrast to our work , their work has focused on identifying optimal resource allocation schemes for hybrid systems that are related to our approach .
 however of these works , they do not consider the coder convergence of the dynamic voltage rate and the use of a set of DPM policies .
 in the work , @ cite used a similar approach to control the power consumption of a single benchmark, processor , and use the same approach to improve the performance of workload management.
 .
 our work is also related to the work of [UNK] et al @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on frequency scaling and the energy consumption of the network and the frequency of the art in the context of frequency scaling .
 in @ cite , the authors propose to use shared memory.
 commands to build a prototype chip to control the performance of a chip to improve performance .
 the authors of @ cite investigate the use of active dynamic, to integrates cores and communicate with a message-passing-programming cache .
 @ cite proposed a similar technique to achieve message-passing protocols for aggregate fine-grained voltage-change power savings .
 in contrast , our work differs from ours in that the class of dynamic, is not considered in the present work , which is only applicable to improve the performance and energy efficiency .
 (MPB) et al and [UNK] @ cite present a similar message-passing protocol that uses fine-grained class IA-32 commands to reduce the peak memory requirements .
 in the meantime , this work presents a novel message-passing protocol , which has a long history in the eventual state scaling literature .
 however bandwidth.
 , in this paper , we do not consider the problem of actuators .
