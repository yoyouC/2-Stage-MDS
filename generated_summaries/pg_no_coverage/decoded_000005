our work is closest to the work of @ cite and @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the informal and Internet-based evaluation of telecommunication ship ship ship capsizing.
 .
 we use a similar approach to detect events in social streams , and use a violation of the dirty log data produced by the context of the graph homomorphism, .
 in contrast to our approach , our approach is based on the assumption that the position of the traumatic log is logarithmic in the number of phones in the stream of the social network .
 the authors in @ cite investigate the detection of significant events in a large number of real-world data graphs .
 @ cite , the authors present a novel event detection approach for several types of dynamic network behaviors , including Twitter , Twitter, , and [UNK] .
 they show that this approach can be used to handle events and reporting the tracking accuracy .
 TurboHOM++, et al @ cite used a wide range of cruise and large data for detecting malicious events , and found that the perceived connections can be found in a broad range of posts .
 however as a matter of fact @ cite @ cite has not been investigated in the literature .
