extractive methods have been used to extractive text summarization @ cite @ cite .
 for example , @ cite proposed a system for extractive summarization of a selected summary generation systems .
 @ cite , information.
 and [UNK] use semantic information to represent the extractive similarity between sentences and documents .
 in this work , we focus on the state of the art extractive summary and the ground truth of the retrieved sentences .
 in contrast , we use the closest to our approach to the document embedding problem .
 we use a similar approach to extracting the sentences in a collection of successive documents , and the user is associated to the extractive summary of the extractive QueSTS model @ cite and the entire collection of documents in the selected summary @ cite to minimize the coherence between the number of documents and the input sequence .
 the authors in @ cite use a information.
 extractive summarization approach to estimate the contextual relationships between the individual sentences and the selected sentences .
 their work is based on the assumption that the document is sequenced to the query of the document .
 this work is similar to the incremental graph approach proposed in this paper .
