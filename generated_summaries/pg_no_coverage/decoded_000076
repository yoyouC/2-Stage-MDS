a number of approaches have been proposed to predict the temporal relation between events and time series @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on self usage of temporal relations between time series and builds a hierarchical codebook model to embed the dependency information into explainable social media .
 in @ cite , the authors show that the temporal path between two kinds of context encoded with recurrent neural networks is able to explain the predictions in the scene .
 @ cite proposed a sequential model for video parsing and learning temporal contextual information into bidirectional recurrent neural nets ( rnn ) .
 in the context of temporal relation classification , our approach is similar to the work of cheng and park @ cite who presented a neural network based approach to predict syntactic structure of tweets , focusing on modeling social and semantic relationships between events.
 and what).
 key events .
 in contrast to our work , they focus on predicting the minimum number of changes in a 3-day prediction system .
 the authors of @ cite investigate the value of a sequence of time series , and use the dominant behaviors.
 tag to the nearest neighbor classifier.
 approach .
 a number of approaches have been proposed to predict failures in the shapelet approach @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the learning of sequence modeling and learning time series .
 the shapelet models have also been used in the context of stochastic gradient learning @ cite , where the shapelet is used to predict taxi demand .
 in contrast to our approach , this approach is based on the assumption that the distances between time series and events are inferred from the time series of the shapelet model .
 in @ cite the authors propose a single shapelet, approach to predict the demand uncertainty of the task .
 @ cite propose a holistic predictive model to predict cities, taxi demand from time series to measure the demand of a taxi shapelets .
 the authors of @ cite use the temporal correlation of human mobility events to estimate the shapelets for taxi demand imbalance can be representative in real world data sets .
 in their work , they use trips to the length of shortest time series , and the temporal continuity of the shortest time of the shapelets are the spikes of the respective shapelets .
 video prediction has been investigated in several contexts , such as speech recognition @ cite @ cite and video summarization @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the use of recurrent neural networks ( rnn ) to predict the sequences of events in a sequence of events .
 in @ cite , the authors show that the latent space defined by the microphone constraint.
 Indeed, can be used to model the phonetic states of the microphones and the environment .
 @ cite proposed a similar approach for video prediction .
 in the context of autoregressive models , the work of @ cite is the closest to ours for visualizing a speech signal , which is similar to our work .
 in contrast , our work is fundamentally different from ours , but it is worth noting that our approach differs from theirs in the sense that the anomalous spikes of the speaker are likely to be drawn from the input series .
 we believe that our attention model is related to normalizing the attention from the time of the microphone and frequency of the speech , and we are able to predict future video frames , which can be interpreted as a sequence .
 our work is also closely related to the work of @ cite and @ cite , who proposed an approach to predict failures in a 3-day prediction window using the explainability approach .
 in this work , we use a TT-format approach to estimate the failures from time series of events , and then use a classifier to predict the performance of the tasks .
 in contrast , our approach exploits the irregularity and the frequency of the spikes of the world logs .
 in @ cite the authors propose a RNN model that extracts the spikes and height of anomalous spikes by using a sequence classification approach .
 @ cite used a similar approach to predicting the number of parameters in a logistic regression with a logistic dependencies, ( svm ) classifier .
 however , their method only focuses on modeling temporal and sequential tasks , but the results are not comparable to our work .
 however it is not clear how to extend this work in the context of sequence modeling , but we believe that our approach is more general , and we do not rely on the fact that we are aware of the work by @ cite .
