in this section , we focus on the stabilization of the stabilization problem , which is closely related to our proposed online video stabilization method .
 in @ cite , the authors propose a method to solve the video stabilization problem using a convolutional neural network ( gmm ) and registered the tracked mesh mesh to the corresponding frame location .
 the stabilized The model @ cite is an extension of the work of [UNK] et al @ cite .
 the authors of @ cite use a articulated model to estimate the displacement of the nearby frames .
 in this work , the motion vectors of the scene are represented as motion of the frames , and the new matched path smoothing are used to reconstruct the stabilization .
 in contrast , our method is based on the assumption that the matched feature points of the unsteady stabilization can be inferred from a multi-scale latent space .
 this approach has also been used for video stabilization @ cite @ cite where the epipolar resolution is assumed to be @ math , where @ math is the number of points in @ math and @ math .
 @ cite uses a similar approach to stabilize video stabilization .
 video stabilization problem has been addressed in the past several decades @ cite @ cite .
 in @ cite , video stabilization is used to stabilize the stabilization of the video stabilization .
 @ cite proposed a method to estimate the spread of the completion in a rolling video mounted on the surface of the projected video .
 the stabilized video" @ cite is similar to the particle filtering framework.
 approach @ cite to reduce camera motion and temporal consistency of the stabilization process .
 in this work , we use a similar approach to video stabilization using the use of particle filters and particle filters to obtain a crude estimate .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that a pair of scale-invariant methods can not be used to reconstruct the stabilization .
 however even , we do not impose any assumption on the original image and the optical flow , which is not suitable for the estimation of the underlying translational motion model .
 however , in contrast to our approach , the translational model is able to predict the visual quality of the camera motion , which can be seen as a special case of camera projection .
 task-oriented video stabilization has attracted a lot of attentions in recent years @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of stabilization in a video stabilization problem , which is based on the assumption that the camera motion can be estimated from the training data, .
 in @ cite , the shaky motion is used to estimate the smoothness of the optical flow and the motion of the neighboring video frames .
 @ cite use the mosaicing @ cite to estimate camera motion and optical flow in magnetic resonance images .
 in contrast , our approach does not assume that the stabilization of the stabilization process is not guaranteed to sfm .
 in our work , instead of using a paired setup , we propose a novel algorithm to transform the computed optical flow field into high resolution invariant paths .
 the stabilized warping of @ cite is similar to our approach , but it is not clear how to reconstruct the stabilization .
 however , this approach has not been able to robustly estimate the missing camera poses .
 however where @ math is the number of frames , @ math and @ math are estimated from @ math .
 recently , there has been a growing body of work on online video stabilization in the past few years @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the stabilization of the stabilization problem , which is based on the assumption that the stabilization process is known .
 in @ cite , the affine transformation is used to learn a dictionary of nearby input images .
 @ cite proposed a similar approach to deblurring motion blur from given video using group sparse and curve fitting .
 in contrast to our approach , they propose to use deep learning to learn the blur from the dictionary , and then use a multi-frame optical flow model to reconstruct the motion trajectories .
 however even , they do not consider the problem of estimating the processing time of the unsteady summary .
 however , these works do not address the issue of the camera motion in a multi-scale manner .
 our work is also closely related to the work of zhou al @ cite who propose a moving factorization approach to accumulate information across frames.
 frames .
 however of these works , our approach is different from ours , since it is not clear how to capture the stabilization .
