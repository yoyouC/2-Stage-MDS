the correspondence estimation problem has been extensively studied in the context of image descriptors @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of non-availability of large training data , which is related to our work .
 our work is different from these works in that we do not assume that the model is able to discriminate between the related set of the image level and the training set .
 in contrast to our approach , our approach is based on the assumption that the consistency constraint reflects the prediction of the class of a randomly selected subset of the sparse codes within the spatial domain .
 the difference is that the loss function is calculated by minimizing the difference between the spatial and sparse activations of the randomly sampled codes .
 we use a similar approach to learn a sparse coding model by combining local image features into a convolutional neural network ( cnn ) .
 the authors of @ cite use a max pooling layer to learn the weights of the input image , and then use a variety of transformations to model training .
 @ cite , the authors propose to learn surrogate classes.
 moves from a set of surrogate class features, which are similar to the Convolutional of the semi-supervised learning algorithm .
 our work is closely related to the recent work of zhou al @ cite , who proposed an approach to discriminate between surrogate classes.
 surrogate class is used to learn correspondence between the disparities produced by a randomly selected ‘seed’ image patch.
 based on the resulting feature representation .
 the network is trained by applying a variety of transformations between the left and right images, of the image reconstruction loss.
 .
 @ cite propose a convolutional neural network to learn a set of surrogate classes.
 Each In , which is similar to the problem of depth prediction .
 in contrast to our work , our framework is more related to non-availability of large training data .
 we show that our model can be seen as an extension of the work by mahendran and vedaldi @ cite in the context of feature learning .
 in this work , we use a similar approach to learn the disparity images from stereo images to stereo depth images .
 we use depth data to estimate disparity from a randomly sampled sampled image from an image .
 the difference between geometric and geometric features is that our learning approach is different from ours , since our approach avoids the consistency of ground truth depth data .
 our work is also closely related to the recent work of @ cite .
 @ cite proposed a semi-supervised learning approach for correspondence estimation using gradient descent method .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of non-availability of semantically related images.
 Due images , which is similar to our work .
 in @ cite , the authors propose to use virtual adversarial perturbations to learn the conditional label distribution of the flow and spatial patterns of the input image , and then train a discriminator to predict the regions of the images .
 the proposed model is able to learn a generative model from the ground truth flow to capture the structural information of multiple videos .
 in contrast to our approach , our approach is based on the assumption that our non-availability model is agnostic to the consistency of the adversarial loss function .
 in our experiments , we show that our approach can be seen as an extension of our work to the segmentation of semantically similar results .
 we demonstrate that our model can achieve better performance than our semi-supervised counterparts of semi-supervised and unsupervised learning .
 our work differs from the previous work @ cite @ cite that we do not rely on the fact that we are aware of the work of this paper .
