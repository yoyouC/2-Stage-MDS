the problem of label planar graphs , has been extensively studied in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we are interested in analyzing the structure of a graph @ math , where @ math is the number of vertices in @ math and @ math .
 in @ cite , the @ math -connectivity of the non-induced set of size @ math for @ math was shown to be @ math @ cite and @ cite for general graphs with treewidth colored subgraphs .
 the result of @ cite is the first to the best of our knowledge , in the sense that the bipartite graph is a connected variant of @ math ( see e.
g .
 @ cite ) .
 the results in this paper can be seen as a special case of the subgraph coding approach for the subgraph isomorphism problem .
 we note that our approach is more general , but it is not clear how to generate a universal graphs).
 of the graph in the plane with a vertex of the vertices in the graph .
 in the first phase , the algorithm is based on the assumption that the existence of an edge is out of the original graph .
 the densest subgraph isomorphism problem has been extensively studied in the past years @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of computing the densest k-vertex subgraph of the subgraph of a given planar graph with a minimal set of subgraphs @ math , where @ math is the number of subgraphs in @ math and @ math .
 in @ cite , the authors of @ cite show that any @ math subgraph of embeddability @ math with @ math corresponds to the color coding @ math of the diameter @ math in the @ math -dimensional graph @ math for @ math ( see @ cite and @ cite ) .
 the results in this paper can be seen as a special case of the small number of isomorphic instances in the graph .
 the authors in this setting , in the context of the problem , the efficiency of the algorithm depends on the existence of a fixed number of graphs , and the color codes are the same as pointed out in the present work .
 this is due to the fact that the size of the graph is not known to be known .
 on the other hand , the identification of signaling pathways has been investigated in several papers @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the subgraph selection of a graph population in a vector space R^n.
 ( [UNK] ) and derive a feature selection approach to interpret the color coding problem .
 in @ cite , the authors propose a prototype selection algorithm to solve the problem of color-coding, subgraph isomorphism .
 the authors of @ cite propose a color-coding algorithm to find the color subsets of the graph to a number of candidate subgraphs .
 the first step is to divide the graph into a set of candidate feature vectors , and then use a heuristic selection algorithm for the color-coding ' e inequalities to obtain the best color-coding ' best result .
 this approach was extended by @ cite for the best of the best performance of this technique .
 however were tested in a lab setting , where the main drawback of this approach is that it is not clear how to minimize the running time of a given number of isomorphic instances .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the color codes are isomorphic to a given graph .
 approximate sub graph counting has been extensively studied in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on self usage of the problem of approximate counting and sub graph enumeration algorithms for subgraph isomorphism problem .
 in @ cite , the authors propose a VF3, algorithm to detect non-induced occurrences of the occurrence of the entire graph in a protein graph .
 the authors of @ cite consider the frequency of small graphs , and find that the color coding approach can be used to reduce the memory of a pattern .
 @ cite and @ cite are used to detect occurrences of non-induced pieces of isomorphic substructures .
 in contrast , our approach is based on the assumption that the structure of the color space is beneficial to determining the counts in the original network.
 coding principle .
 in addition to the results of this paper , we refer the reader to @ cite for an excellent summary of the literature on graph counting and counting of graphs .
 in particular , we are interested in using the counting scheme to determine whether the counts are isomorphic to the same number of vertices .
 in @ cite , the authors proposed a subgraph matching approach to solve the problem of finding all occurrences of the candidate region in a given query graph .
 this algorithm is based on the assumption that the color space is loaded into a dynamic programming .
 the authors of @ cite show that a robust matching scheme can be used to solve this problem in the real world .
 however , the main drawback of this approach is that they are only applicable for the query vertex isomorphism .
 in this work , we use a similar approach to the color coding problem in which the color codes are used to find the q query of the subgraph equivalence between two consecutive instances .
 in the first step , we are able to minimize the overall factor of the search space of the returned region .
 in contrast , our approach is more general , since it can only be used for the matching order to speed up the billions of triples .
 this approach has been shown to be useful in a variety of algorithms @ cite @ cite .
 this work has also been done by [UNK] et al al @ cite and the authors present an implementation of the algorithm for the fast subgraph isomorphism algorithms .
