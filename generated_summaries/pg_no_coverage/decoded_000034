in this section , we briefly review existing work related to clustering and community detection algorithms .
 for example , @ cite and @ cite provide a detailed overview of clustering and clustering algorithms for fine-grained control of the affinity matrix .
 @ cite , the authors present a parallel isolation benchmarking platform for fine-grained parallel isolation .
 their work is based on the use of a binning technique to find a cluster of a given seed vertex .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of finding a graph that is most likely to be drawn from the input graph , which is the most relevant to our work .
 the authors of @ cite investigate the task of finding the sets of nodes in the entire graph , and find that the execution time of an input is the number of clusters belonging to the cache policy) .
 in contrast , we do not consider the gap between the two isolation algorithms , and we are not aware of any sort of diverse clustering algorithms .
 we believe that our clustering algorithms can be used to provide human-readable clustering benchmarking framework, for a wide range of synthetic datasets .
