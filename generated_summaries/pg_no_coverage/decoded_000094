there has been a number of works on causal stochastic reinforcement learning ( [UNK] ) @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on a large body of work on action understanding , which is closely related to our work .
 in @ cite , the authors propose a generative model for modeling human action understanding.
 from hidden relationships between agents and actions .
 @ cite use a nonparametric approach to predict future actions in a social network .
 in their work , they use a bayesian approach to learn the latent structure of their actions .
 in contrast , our goal is to maximize the beliefs of the subgoal , which can be inferred from the subgoal to infer the goals, of the matrix game .
 this approach is similar to the work of @ cite and @ cite who focus on improving the state of the art in the context of social dilemmas .
 in particular , @ cite explore the use of deep belief propagation in a nonparametric manner to predict the number of actions .
 however , these works do not take into account the underlying relationships between actions and actions , but they are not applicable to our setting .
