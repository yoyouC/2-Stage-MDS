the most related work to ours is @ cite @ cite .
 the authors of @ cite propose a hierarchical clustering algorithm to find the latent cluster structure based on the sparsity of the clusters at the same time .
 @ cite use a voting model to exploit the locality of the synthetic data to handle the trade-off between various architectures and contribute to the noise attenuation .
 in @ cite , the inferred types of the data are used to learn the similarity between the similarity matrix and the occurrence of the inferred clusters .
 in this work , we use a feature-centric voting scheme to estimate the processing complexity of the type of weighted vectors .
 in contrast to our approach , our approach is different from ours , since we are able to reduce the number of clusters in the knowledge base .
 our approach differs from theirs in two ways .
 first , we do not consider the problem of StaTIX, types of knowledge bases , which is the focus of our work .
 we are interested in the following work @ cite that we are aware of the first to show that it is possible to use link-based type inference for parallel computing .
