the notion of coordinate expansion of test graph has been studied in @ cite @ cite .
 the authors of @ cite have studied the testability of the test graph @ math and @ math , where @ math is the number of points @ math .
 @ cite , @ cite and @ cite show that the local expansion, and local properties of a string can be found in polynomial time @ math for @ math ( see @ cite for a more general definition of @ math ) .
 in this work , the authors show that coordinate descent algorithms can be used to find a coordinate expander for a speaking @math graph testability , which can be interpreted as a direct product of a test graph.
 .
 the results are referred to as @ cite ( see also @ cite ) .
 however , these works do not consider the problem of testability , but we do not impose any restrictions on the number @math of the distribution , but do not use a product of the coefficient function @ math in the vertex set @ math graphs , which are trivially satisfied in our setting .
 the notion of coordinate expansion has been studied in the context of finding a submodular function @ math , where @ math is the number of vertices in @ math and @ math .
 @ cite gave a @ math -approximation algorithm for the hypercube graph , and @ cite proved to be @ math -hard even for the submodular function .
 in @ cite , the authors show that for any @ math -vertex graph @ math with @ math number of the form @ math of size @ math in the @ math -th eigenvalues of the submodular expander if @ math for @ math are @ math @ cite @ cite .
 in the subsequent work , cohen and [UNK] @ cite showed that the minimum size of a string @ math satisfies @ math ( for any certain constant @ math ) .
 in this setting , the minimisation of a submodular expander testability.
 is a compact product of the speaking , which is known to be np-hard @ cite ; see @ cite for an excellent summary of the results of this work .
 In @ cite is an extension of the present work .
 the notion of coordinate expansion has been studied extensively in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of finding a desired coordinate expander if the target from a pair of clusters can be interpreted as a weighted sum of the input distance .
 @ cite , @ cite and @ cite studied the computation of the objective function for the size of the test graph .
 in @ cite the authors show that the expected closest-pair problem is the -close to direct local expansion, and the expected -threshold probability of a test graph with global and local expansion, condition .
 the authors of @ cite show that for any constant @ math , @ math for @ math and @ math is a set of @ math .
 the results obtained by @ cite were the first algorithm for the closest-pair -means problem .
 in particular , it was shown that the existence of an independent existence of the closest-pair distance of the domain @ math in @ math time @ math has @ math to be @ math ( @ math ) .
 this approach was later extended to @ cite for the case of @math -median .
