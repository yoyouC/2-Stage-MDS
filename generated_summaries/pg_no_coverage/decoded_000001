there has been a growing body of work on interactive dialogue systems for dialogue management @ cite @ cite .
 for example , in @ cite , the authors use reinforcement learning to learn dialogue policies from the information of the value of the dialogue policy .
 @ cite use a set of approximate dynamic programming for dialogue policy based on a bayesian approach .
 in this work , we use a similar approach to the dialogue system .
 in contrast to our approach , they are able to predict dialogue in a conversational system , and the system is able to learn a sparse representation of users ' norms .
 in the work of @ cite and @ cite the authors propose to learn policies from data, versions of the state of the art in the context of a sequence of dialogue systems , and use a bayesian model to learn good dialogue strategies .
 in their work , they propose a novel system to predict the dialogue downstream spoken dialogue systems using a conversational seed conversation .
 they also proposed the use of a reinforcement learning approach to tackle the problem of retrieving train and select dialogue policies .
