there has been a growing body of work on stochastic control in the literature @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the problem of wind products and wind induced by the stochastic unit ( see @ cite for a survey ) .
 in @ cite , the value of the model is studied in the context of poisson linear programming ( pomdp ) , where the utility function of the commitment approach is used to estimate the exchange rates of different frequency response products in the electricity system.
 model .
 @ cite proposed a computationally efficient mixed integer linear programming model that optimizes a flexible schedule for load curtailment.
 and underfrequency mandatory products of lost values between frequency response and wind mandatory generation .
 in the work of Britain.
 et al , @ cite and @ cite provide a similar approach to cost-effectively reserve services in power systems .
 however , their work does not consider the balancing of response times and the energy consumption of products in comparison to the electricity ancillary services .
 in contrast , our work focuses on the reserve and schedule inertial response, , which is the focus of our work .
