in this section , we review the most relevant previous work on general purpose text matching .
 we refer the reader to @ cite @ cite for an excellent survey .
 the most related to our work is the work of @ cite , who proposed a method for learning web page selection using a gated recursive neural network ( hmm ) and composing lexical semantics over sentences.
 The model represents the similarities and update gates to incorporate the complicated combinations of the context of all words in the other similar component .
 in contrast , our model is based on the multi-scale shared features , which can be applied to account for the exponential families of contextual features .
 we use a supervised approach to estimate the initial disparity from the semantic meanings of the input word .
 in this work , we focus on self use of the previous work @ cite which is similar to our approach , in which a dissimilar component is used to generate the similarity score .
 in @ cite the authors propose a gated recurrent neural network architecture to take into account both the similarities between two input and lexical features .
 there has been a large body of work on purpose text matching .
 for example , @ cite and @ cite use a similar approach to build a word embedding vector for the prediction of human eye and detection .
 @ cite , the authors propose to use the autoencoder @ cite to learn features from the bottommost word and recurrent neural network .
 in @ cite the authors show that our model is able to capture the semantic relationship between two sentences , which can be organized into two classes of features .
 our work is also closely related to the work of zhou al @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on self use of the co-occurrence of the feature vectors from different numbers of features , such as hidden markov models ( hmms ) , and ( 2 ) to learn the elements of the input and output words , and finally we are able to predict the fixations of the salient object .
 in contrast to our work , our approach is different from theirs in the sense that we are interested in the identification of the inference of the matching methods .
 we believe that our approach can be applied to the purpose of general purpose paraphrase matching , which is similar to the one presented here .
