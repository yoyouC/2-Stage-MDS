there has been a growing body of work on community structure @ cite @ cite .
 in this work , we focus on the investigation of social and complex network processes , which can be used to detect the community structure of social networks and the distribution of the network structure , and the accuracy of the observed network structure .
 in @ cite , the authors proposed a method to estimate the diversity of individualsâ€™ relationships between the nodes of the community .
 the authors of @ cite have proposed a probabilistic model for detecting the structure of a community in social network networks .
 in their work , they use a fast independent cascade model based on the observation that the nodes are represented by the network nodes .
 the model is modeled as a mixture of gaussian distributions of the adjacency matrices of each vertex and each vertex corresponds to a vertex of a vertex .
 the similarity of the nodes is then used to define the edges of each node .
 the algorithm assigns each vertex to each vertex , and each cell is assigned to the next vertex .
 each leaf node is associated with each vertex in each cell , and then the graph is responsible for each vertex .
 there has been a growing body of work in the area of link-prediction , see @ cite @ cite and references therein .
 in this section , we briefly review related work related to our work .
 in particular , we are interested in seeing the most important differences between the nodes and the distribution of the networks .
 in @ cite , a differentially network is used to estimate the missing community structure .
 @ cite use a mixture of coupled hierarchical cascade diffusion data.
 @ cite to fit the network to predict the evolving network .
 however , they do not consider the dynamics of the network , but do not impose any assumption on the observation of the cascade model .
 in contrast to our approach , our approach is based on the assumption that the infections are close to each other of a set of infections @ cite .
 we show that our approach can be seen as an extension of the work of @ cite that looks at estimating the distance between the two nodes in the network and recovered the best uncertainty of the dynamics in the recovered samples .
 the difference is that the probability of a node is estimated from the likelihood function .
