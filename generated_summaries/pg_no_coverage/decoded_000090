the effect of long-term instability in multi-antenna multi-antenna systems was studied in @ cite and @ cite .
 @ cite proposed a randomizing pilot architecture for analyze the assessment of the assessment and resilience of the latter .
 the authors of @ cite investigate the risk of optimizing the distance between the hidden channel and independence feature and the energy rate of the two orthogonal moments .
 in this work , the authors show that the closed-form expression of the jamming and the identification of sub-codebooks of the multi-user gossip can be found in the publicly available step .
 the results obtained in this paper can be viewed as a special case where the hetnet condition is assumed to be assumed to belong to the original legitimate channel .
 in the first time , the identification error is estimated from the average degree of the target signal , and the resulting upper bounds are derived from the asymptotic bound of @ math .
 however where @ math , @ math and @ math for @ math are the spoofing training rate @ cite @ cite , and this is the analog of the @ math -th eigenvalues of the mimo bands @ cite ; see @ cite for an excellent survey .
